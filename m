Since there is some elaborate talk going about this, let me throw in
my own $0,03 -- I may happen to have a simple solution which will sort
it out and it boils down to storing local ref updates in task_struct.

Here is the context: creds are always refed and unrefed when creating
and destroying a file object. Should you have one instance of
credentials for a given user across different processes they would
serialize on updating the ref. Linux mostly dodges the problem by
always creating a copy on fork, thus only serializing within threads
of a given process. Even then that induces avoidable overhead if only
from single-threaded standpoint -- that's 2 atomics slapped for every
open/close cycle.

$elsewhere I devised an idea where cred ref updates to creds matching
current->cred only modify a local counter. They get rolled up when
current->creds is changed. That is to say there is 0 atomics or
modifying memory seen by other cpus as long as the process does not
change creds, which almost never happens compared to how often refing
and unrefing is implemented.

In struct cred apart from regular refs you would have "user" counter
and "distributed" counter. switching user to > 0 grabs a normal ref on
creds, the value of the "distributed" counter is arbitrary as long as
user > 0. users going back to 0 means we can release the special ref
held for that purpose.

I was considering implementing this for Linux. In my original code all
cred handling is augmented like this, but for Linux one could add a
dedicated get_cred_localref or similar machinery.

Skimming through apparmor suggests the bit which does cause
performance problems can be sorted out in the same manner.

Maybe i'll hack it up as a demo just for apparmor.

This would come with some extra space usage in task_struct which on
the surface may sounds like a non-starter. However, should you take a
look at the struct with pahole you will find it is riddles with
padding. If I wanted to I could add all fields I need to the struct
and not grow it on LP64.

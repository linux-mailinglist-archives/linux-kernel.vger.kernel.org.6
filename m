I believe we don't need to try so hard to detect if sampling is
supported or not.  I hope we will eventually add that to the
kernel.  Also this is just an additional defense line, it should
work without it in most cases.  It'll just protect from a few edge
cases like uncore PMUs having events of legacy name.  For
other events or PMUs, I think it's ok to fail.

Right, if we use pr_err() then users will complain.  If we use
pr_debug() then errors will be hidden silently.

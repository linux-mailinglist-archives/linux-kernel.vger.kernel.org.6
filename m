Thanks for your suggestion. I think using python scripting, similar to 
bcc, is more suitable for scenarios with complex requirements.
For some simple and lightweight scenarios, such as just printing some 
information in real time, one-line command (similar to dtrace)may be 
more suitable to implement user-defined sample.
This is just my idea, hope to discuss to improve the usability of 
perf-tool. :-)

Yes, we can greatly simplify the development work by using python.
In the end, if we can allow users to import perf python library and use 
a few simple codes to implement a customized data collection, it will be 
of great help to improve the usability of the perf tool.


Actually, I think perf-tool has a lot of functions and is very helpful 
for performance optimization, but the threshold is relatively high for 
beginners. (I donâ€™t know if this is appropriate :-))

I have some considerations in improving the usability of the tool, but I 
donâ€™t know if it is appropriate:
1. Provide rich prompt information, such as perf-help can provide some 
user requirements in an interactive way, provide common perf commands 
and usage methods; or provide some usage cases through keywords
2. Use some graphical interfaces as the backend so that users can use it 
in an easy-to-understand way
3. Based on the python you mentioned above, I think it is a good way to 
allow some developers to customize sampling data more easily.


Thanks,
Yang.

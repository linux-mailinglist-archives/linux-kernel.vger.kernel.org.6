Please, just use ther *exact* wording I asked for last time:

At this point in the commit message, the 'has_branch_stack' flag doesn't
matter, and dropping the 'to' after 'opt-in' makes this painful to read.

Please delete this paragraph.

At this point in the series I understand why we have the 'branches' and
'branch_users' fields, but the 'branch_context' and 'branch_sample_type'
fields haven't been introduced and are not obvious.

What exactly is branch_context, and why is that a 'void *' ?

I can understand if that's a PMU-specific structure to track the active
branch records, but if so I don't understand why 'branch_sample_type'
isn't folded into that.

Mark.

Then your binding is incomplete, I would say. What stops anyone from
providing the same GPIO for CS in controller node, like typical bindings
expect?

You just described CS gpio in parent controller node.

You mix two different things. Where the property should be described and
how it should be handled. child driver is not the matter of bindings.

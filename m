That function is passed *1* event. It is not intended to go looking at
all events or muck with any global state. Could we go poking around
all the data structures? Probably, it's C and data structures are
often not opaque when they should be, so that wouldn't be a good idea.
If you think it is, I'd recommend you stay away from Rust.

Furthermore, an event here may not actually be enabled. A user could
open 2 events and handle them as mutually exclusive continuously
disabling one and enabling the other. If the branch filters that they
want are not overlapping, we'd be reducing our effective branch record
size. Maximizing the size seems much more important to me than keeping
some branches in a few corner cases.

Suppose we do that, what happens when a 2nd session (as Mark pointed
out, sessions only exist in the perf tool, not the kernel) adds more
events. We configured the filters and now we have to change them
again. So we have to invalidate the branch record. It's the same thing
with event rotation (though less frequent (probably)).

So you miss the few times that happens in a context switch. But we are
sampling and all/most of the other samples are going to be fine. How
much is that really going to affect your profile?

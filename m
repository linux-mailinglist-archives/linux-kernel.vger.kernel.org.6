Do you mean that sample all the events in a metrics, and report both
samples and its metrics calculation result in the report?
That doesn't work for all the metrics.

- For the topdown related metrics, especially on ICL and later
platforms, the perf metrics feature is used by default. It doesn't
support sampling.
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/perf/Documentation/topdown.txt?#n293
- Some PMUs which doesn't support sampling as well, e.g., uncore, Power,
MSR.
- There are some SW events, e.g.,duration_time, you may don't want to do
sampling

You probable need to introduce a flag to ignore those metrics in perf
record.

It sounds more reasonable to me that we can sample some typical events,
and read the other members in the metrics. So we can put metrics next to
the code in perf report/annotate as Ian mentioned. It could also address
limits of some metrics, especially for the topdown related metrics.
(But I'm not sure if the "Sample with" can give you the right hints. I
will ask around internally.)

But there is also some limits for the sampling read. Everything has to
be in a group. That could be a problem for some big metrics.
Thanks,
Kan

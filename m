Heh, a lazy user would just enable the controller and hope for the best.
And it would actually worked out of the box because there is no limit
imposed by default so the only downside is a theoretical overhead due to
charging.

Anyway, I get the point and I guess it is fair to say the half baked
memcg accounting is not optimal because it only provides half baked
insight and you aim to fix that. This is fair intentention and
justification.

I have to say I really disliked this extension to the memcg when it was
proposed but it was claimed this was good enough for people who know
what they are doing.

Thanks a lot!

I think clarification and fixing the reporting is good enough. This
still won't make the hugetlb sneaking into memcg more likeable to me but
nothing that would force me awake during nights ;)

Thanks!

I'm glad to see progress on this front ! Please see feedback below.

The tracepoints try very hard to minimize overhead of dormant tracepoints
so it is not frowned-upon to have them built into production binaries.
This is needed to make sure distribution vendors keep those tracepoints
in the kernel binaries that reach end-users.

Adding a function call before evaluation of the static branch goes against
this major goal.

This tradeoff is more acceptable than having a function call before
evaluation of the static branch, but I wonder what is the upside of
this tradeoff compared to inlining the whole __DO_TRACE in Rust ?

I don't see how the duplication happens there: __DO_TRACE is meant to be
inlined into each C tracepoint caller site, so the code is already meant
to be duplicated. Having an explicit function wrapping the tracepoint
for Rust would just create an extra instance of __DO_TRACE if it happens
to be also inlined into C code.

Or do you meant you would like to prevent having to duplicate the
implementation of __DO_TRACE in both C and Rust ?

I'm not sure if you mean to prevent source code duplication between
C and Rust or duplication of binary code (instructions).

Thanks,

Mathieu

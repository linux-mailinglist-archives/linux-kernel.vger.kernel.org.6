It's still up in the air, I think.

My personal opinion is that there's only DRM (and accel) devices that
really care about scheduling constraints anyway, so it wouldn't (have
to) be as generic as this one.

And if we would call it dma, then the naming becomes a bit weird since
DMA doesn't have much to do with scheduling.

But I guess it's just another instance of the "naming is hard" problem :)

Tetsuo's comparison may be a bit strained, but it remains relevant.

Linux was founded on a concept of choice, the current LSM architecture
struggles with the ability to facilitate generalized choice and
flexibility.

This line of reasoning represents a bit of an indulgence in a false
binary logic fallacy.

Anyone reading this forum is certainly capable of building a kernel in
any configuration they want to.  That being said, the general Linux
technical community now represents a cohort far larger than
individuals who have the ability to build and platform a kernel of
their choosing.

From a security perspective, Linux will benefit from providing a
better means to serve a middle ground where alternate security models
and architectures can be implemented without building a kernel from
scratch.

Not everything.

As of the TSEM V4 release, which is now a month old, we have proposed
a middle ground that provides multiple mechanisms for the mainsteam
kernel to support alternate security models in an orthogonal manner,
but it has struggled to receive any significant review.

The V4 release now includes the ability to use loadable modules to
implement customized security models.  The premise for this support is
to replace the need for a dynamic LSM with an LSM that has dynamic
configurability.

Bandwidth is always in short supply, but some internal investigation
by our team has demonstrated that the TSEM architecture can implement
Tomoyo as a loadable security model.

TSEM also provides a framework for servicing the needs of Endpoint
Detection and Response systems without having to write any kernel code
at all.  This same mechanism also facilitates the ability to apply
machine learning detection and intervention models, a capability that
is notably absent from any of the existing LSM's.

For the record and everyone reading along at home, here are the links
to the four releases:

V1:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20230204050954.11583-1-greg@enjellic.com/T/#t

V2:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20230710102319.19716-1-greg@enjellic.com/T/#t

V3:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20240401105015.27614-1-greg@enjellic.com/T/#t

V4:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20240826103728.3378-1-greg@enjellic.com/T/#t

We believe that making some forward progress with review and inclusion
of TSEM would positively impact the issues under discussion.

As a side comment about this, even though we certain can and should make
the Kernel more robust to skip possible bad replies from FW (like with this
or similar patches), if the bad replies comes by design since, as I have
grasped from the other thread, the FW just ALSO exposes resources/OPPs that
are just NOT usable by the Kernel OSPM/agent (but maybe by other agents),
you should fix your FW to fully avoid the warnings...since the warnings in
SCMI/perf are there exactly to catch this kind of situations...
(even though we can deal better with the replies as with this patch)

IOW, the SCMI server should expose to its agents only the subset of
resources and characteristics that are supposed to be used by those
respective agents (server can expose a per-agent view of the system)...

...because, even if innocuous and even though most of the time we can cope
with such "alien" resources (with the FW simply replying with a DENY to any
request not meant to be touched or the Kernel spotting such anomalies and
ignoring them) all of these "alien" resources will generate some sort of
uneeded background SCMI traffic (of DENY replies)

Thanks,
Cristian

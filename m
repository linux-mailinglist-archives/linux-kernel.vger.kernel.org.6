No, it's 660, but in consequence of that every user of the TPM is a
member of the tpm group which, since TPM use from userspace is growing,
is everyone, so it might as well have been 666.  In other words relying
on access restrictions to the TPM itself is largely useless.

Well, that's correct, but a TPM key file without policy still has two
protections: the file itself (so the key owner can choose what
permissions and where it is) and the key authority (or password)
although for the mechanical (unsupervised insertion) use case keys tend
not to have an authority.

Well, that was based on constructing a policy that meant only the
kernel could access the data (so it requires PCR policy).

In addition to the expected secrecy property question which I don't
think is fully answered I did think of another issue: what if the
application needs to rotate keys because of a suspected compromise? 
For sealed keys, we just generate a new one an use that in place of the
old, but for your derived keys we'd have to change one of the mixing
values, which all look to be based on fairly permanent properties of
the system.

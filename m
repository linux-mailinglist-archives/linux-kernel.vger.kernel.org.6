I only partially agree here.

On weakly-ordered architectures, indeed we don't care whether the
issue is caused by the compiler reordering the code (constant)
or the CPU speculating the load (registers).

However, on strongly-ordered architectures, AFAIU, only the constant
case is problematic (compiler reordering the dependent load), because
CPU speculating the loads across the control dependency is not an
issue.

So am I tempted to keep examples that clearly state whether
the issue is caused by compiler reordering instructions, or by
CPU speculation.

Replacing with:

  * This is needed to prevent the compiler CSE and SSA GVN optimizations

As per my earlier comment, I would prefer to keep the examples specific
rather than general so it is clear which scenarios are problematic on
weakly vs strongly ordered architectures.

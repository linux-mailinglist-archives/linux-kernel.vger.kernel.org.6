I have alternative proposal that hit me today.

First an observation: I think this issue shows that we also stress
beyond limits desktop configurations with encrypted bus, even tho it is
not in the same way visible. This affects bunch of things, including
e.g. power consumption. Not a lot but best possible situation would be
if callers could be served without any additional stress.

A second observation is in [1]:=20

"It is recommended that a TPM implement the RNG in a manner that would
allow it to return RNG octets such that, as long as the value of
bytesRequested is not greater than the maximum digest size, the
frequency of bytesRequested being more than the number of octets
available is an infrequent occurrence."

I think from this we can derive a fair assumption that with any possible
TPM2 chip we can pull a 32 byte value within a single transcation (i.e.
matching SHA256 digest size).

So based on these facts I think this might be a sweet spot in making a
compromise between performance and security:

1. Generate a 32 byte seed every N iterations (calls of
   tpm2_get_random(). Store it to chip->random_seed.
2. In-between iterations use PRNG to generate the values
   starting form chip->random_seed.

I think N could be fairly large without causing any major difference
(even when analyzed through numerical error analysis) between calling
TPM2_GetRandom for each and every iteration. And this way bus encryption
never has to be disabled.

I'd see this as win-win approach.

PS. I have no idea what kind of PRNG's kernel provides (never used
such).

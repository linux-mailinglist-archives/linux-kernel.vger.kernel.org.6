I understand but I can imagine the following conversation if we rename that:

   User: "I updated my kernel and now my (non Perf) tool fails to open
          the DSU cycles event because it doesn't exist anymore"

   Linus/maintainers: "Oh ok yes that was a userspace breaking change,
                      lets revert it"

Just because Perf can handle 3 different names for cycles doesn't mean 
other tools can.

I'm not sure about that. The M PMU events may be incomplete, but the two 
that are there have a mapping that looks sane:

   static const unsigned m1_pmu_perf_map[PERF_COUNT_HW_MAX] = {
	PERF_MAP_ALL_UNSUPPORTED,
	[PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES]	= M1_PMU_PERFCTR_CPU_CYCLES,
	[PERF_COUNT_HW_INSTRUCTIONS]	= M1_PMU_PERFCTR_INSTRUCTIONS,
	/* No idea about the rest yet */
   };

And they map to the same named events:

   static struct attribute *m1_pmu_event_attrs[] = {
	M1_PMU_EVENT_ATTR(cycles, M1_PMU_PERFCTR_CPU_CYCLES),
	M1_PMU_EVENT_ATTR(instructions, M1_PMU_PERFCTR_INSTRUCTIONS),
	NULL,
   };

So in this case I can't see using legacy vs sysfs events making a 
difference. Maybe there is some other case that was mentioned in a 
previous thread that I missed though.

Yep makes sense to do the revert if RISC-V isn't going to support any 
legacy events. Although from what I understand that would technically 
only require JSON to be the highest priority? Because putting named 
events in sysfs still requires kernel involvement so doesn't get you any 
further than supporting the legacy events?

Seems like there is another reason to do the revert though as Mark 
mentioned: That now directly specifying the PMU eg "-e 
arm_cortex_a56/cycles/" opens a legacy event if the event matches one, 
which is not the best thing to do. But the revert fixes this AFAIK, so 
while having the priority JSON/legacy/sysfs might work for RISC-V it 
wouldn't work for a platform that wants a slightly different sysfs event 
than legacy but with the same name. And the priority should be 
JSON/sysfs/legacy.

Yep I don't have any strong feelings about this. Even if we don't merge 
it it helped me understand the code and the issue a bit.

I think one thing I assumed about your change was that there was some 
dependency on these other changes. But the more I look at it I think 
it's actually fine on it's own?

Using the cycles string actually works today, even on Apple M. The only 
real remaining issue is softening the error for failure to open, but 
that's _after_ doing the revert of the revert and is separate.

I will re-test that one today with fresh eyes.

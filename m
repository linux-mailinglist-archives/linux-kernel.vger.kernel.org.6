Though I did not found a straightforward case in Perf for initializing
union with "{0}", the result I got:

$ git grep -E "\{ *0 *\}" tools/perf/
tools/perf/arch/x86/tests/insn-x86.c:   {{0}, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL},
tools/perf/arch/x86/tests/insn-x86.c:   {{0}, 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL},
tools/perf/arch/x86/tests/intel-pt-test.c:      {1, {0}, 0, {INTEL_PT_PAD, 0, 0}, 0, 1 },
tools/perf/arch/x86/tests/intel-pt-test.c:      {0, {0}, 0, {0, 0, 0}, 0, 0 },
tools/perf/arch/x86/util/perf_regs.c:   char new_reg[SDT_REG_NAME_SIZE] = {0};
tools/perf/arch/x86/util/perf_regs.c:   char prefix[3] = {0};
tools/perf/builtin-kwork.c:             .nr_skipped_events   = { 0 },
tools/perf/builtin-record.c:    u8 pad[8] = {0};
tools/perf/python/twatch.py:                    print("cpu: {0}, pid: {1}, tid: {2} {3}".format(event.sample_cpu,
tools/perf/tests/code-reading.c:        unsigned char buf1[BUFSZ] = {0};
tools/perf/tests/code-reading.c:        unsigned char buf2[BUFSZ] = {0};
tools/perf/util/bpf_counter.c:  struct bpf_map_info map_info = {0};
tools/perf/util/bpf_kwork.c:    char name[MAX_KWORKNAME] = { 0 };
tools/perf/util/bpf_skel/bperf_follower.bpf.c:  struct bperf_filter_value child_fval = { 0 };
tools/perf/util/lzma.c: char buf[6] = { 0 };
tools/perf/util/mem-events.c:bool perf_mem_record[PERF_MEM_EVENTS__MAX] = { 0 };
tools/perf/util/mem-events.c:   char hit_miss[5] = {0};
tools/perf/util/trace-event-scripting.c:        char xs[16] = {0};
tools/perf/util/zlib.c: char buf[2] = { 0 };

We can see the bpf structures (bpf_map_info/bperf_filter_value) are
initialized with {0}.  For a more complex case, {0} is used for
initialize a specific field in a structure (see the results in
insn-x86.c and intel-pt-test.c).

I think Linux perf shares the same understanding with "we do expect
initializers that always initialize the whole variable fully" (quote
in [1]).  Furthermore, the reply mentioned:

 The exact same problem happens with "{ 0 }" as happens with "{ }".
 The bug is literally that some versions of clang seem to implement
 BOTH of these as "initialize the first member of the union", which
 then means that if the first member isn't the largest member, the
 rest of the union is entirely undefined.

So I think it is reasonable to imposes a compiler option to make
compiler's behavouir consistent.

Thanks,
Leo

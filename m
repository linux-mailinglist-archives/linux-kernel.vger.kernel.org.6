It's even worse than that: RISC-V doesn't even mandate any working 
_instructions_, much less anything in the platform/firmware.

Ya, I'd call that a regression.  Updating the firmware on these things 
isn't generally something we can rely on users to do, we've worked 
around other firmware bugs where we can to avoid forced updates.

It doesn't really matter what the specs say (aka intended to say in 
RISC-V land): if there's a regression then we have to deal with it.  
It's not like whatever's written in the specs actually matters, vendors 
can just do whatever they want, so wer'e just stuck making the known 
implementations work.

So I think if the revert is the best fix then we should revert it.

That said: If the CLINT works, could we just add a probing quirk to make 
it appear on these systems even when it's not in the DT?  I'm thinking 
something like adding a compatibly string to the CLINT driver for the 
SOC (or core or whatever, just something that's already there).  We'd 
probably need a bit of special-case probing code, but shouldn't be so 
bad.  We've got some other compatibility-oriented DT quirks floating 
around.

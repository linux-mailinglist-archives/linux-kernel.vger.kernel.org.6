Adding my thoughts that humble and biased as a DAMON maintainer.  The thoughts
are about the general problem, not about this patchset.  So please think below
as a sort of my "thinking loud" or "btw I use DAMON", and ignore those when
discussing about this specific patch series.

DAMON's access check mechanisms use PG_idle which is updated by
folio_mark_accessed(), and hence DAMON can monitor access to unmapped pages.
DAMON also supports migrating pages of specific access pattern to an arbitrary
NUMA node.  So, promoting unmapped page cache folios using DAMON might be
another way.

More specifically, users could use only DAMON for both promoting and demoting
of every page like HMSDK[1] does, or for only unmapped pages promotion.  I
think the former idea might work given previous test results, and I proposed an
idea[2] to make it more general (>2 tiers) and easy to tune using DAMOS quota
auto-tuning feature before.  All features for the proposed idea[2] are
available starting v6.11.   For the latter idea, though, I'm not sure how
beneficial it would be, and whether it makes sense at all.

For people who might be interested in it, or just how DAMON can be used for
such weird idea, I posted an RFC patch[3] for making DAMON be able to be used
for the use case.  For easy testing from anyone who interested, I also pushed
DAMON user-space tool's support of the new filter to a temporal branch[4].  The
temporal branch[4] might be erased later.

Note that I haven't test any of the two changes for the unmapped pages only
promotion idea, and have no ETA for any test.  Those are only for concept level
idea sharing.

DAMON runs on a separate kthread, so DAMON-based approach maybe categorized
into this one.

Hi Marc,

I believe the intent of this patch is to protect the host/KVM against a guest
that is using BBML2. The host/KVM always assumes BBML0 and therefore doesn't do
any operations that are allowed by the arch to cause a conflict abort. Therefore
the host doesn't need to handle it. But a guest could be taking advantage of
BBML2 and therefore it's architiecturally possible for a conflict abort to be
raised to EL2. I think today that would take down the host?

So really I think this could be considered a stand-alone KVM hardening improvement?

If the host isn't doing any BBML2 operations it doesn't need to handle it, I
don't think? Obviously that changes later in the series and Miko is adding the
required handling to the host.

Ryan

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
-The June 2015 version of Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer
-Manuals, Chapter 36 Intel Processor Trace, defined new Intel PT features.
-Some of the features are reflect in new config terms.  All the config terms are
-described below.
-
-tsc		Always supported.  Produces TSC timestamp packets to provide
-		timing information.  In some cases it is possible to decode
-		without timing information, for example a per-thread context
-		that does not overlap executable memory maps.
-
-		The default config selects tsc (i.e. tsc=1).
-
-noretcomp	Always supported.  Disables "return compression" so a TIP packet
-		is produced when a function returns.  Causes more packets to be
-		produced but might make decoding more reliable.
-
-		The default config does not select noretcomp (i.e. noretcomp=0).
-
-psb_period	Allows the frequency of PSB packets to be specified.
-
-		The PSB packet is a synchronization packet that provides a
-		starting point for decoding or recovery from errors.
-
-		Support for psb_period is indicated by:
-
-			/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/psb_cyc
-
-		which contains "1" if the feature is supported and "0"
-		otherwise.
-
-		Valid values are given by:
-
-			/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/psb_periods
-
-		which contains a hexadecimal value, the bits of which represent
-		valid values e.g. bit 2 set means value 2 is valid.
-
-		The psb_period value is converted to the approximate number of
-		trace bytes between PSB packets as:
-
-			2 ^ (value + 11)
-
-		e.g. value 3 means 16KiB bytes between PSBs
-
-		If an invalid value is entered, the error message
-		will give a list of valid values e.g.
-
-			$ perf record -e intel_pt/psb_period=15/u uname
-			Invalid psb_period for intel_pt. Valid values are: 0-5
-
-		If MTC packets are selected, the default config selects a value
-		of 3 (i.e. psb_period=3) or the nearest lower value that is
-		supported (0 is always supported).  Otherwise the default is 0.
-
-		If decoding is expected to be reliable and the buffer is large
-		then a large PSB period can be used.
-
-		Because a TSC packet is produced with PSB, the PSB period can
-		also affect the granularity to timing information in the absence
-		of MTC or CYC.
-
-mtc		Produces MTC timing packets.
-
-		MTC packets provide finer grain timestamp information than TSC
-		packets.  MTC packets record time using the hardware crystal
-		clock (CTC) which is related to TSC packets using a TMA packet.
-
-		Support for this feature is indicated by:
-
-			/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/mtc
-
-		which contains "1" if the feature is supported and
-		"0" otherwise.
-
-		The frequency of MTC packets can also be specified - see
-		mtc_period below.
-
-mtc_period	Specifies how frequently MTC packets are produced - see mtc
-		above for how to determine if MTC packets are supported.
-
-		Valid values are given by:
-
-			/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/mtc_periods
-
-		which contains a hexadecimal value, the bits of which represent
-		valid values e.g. bit 2 set means value 2 is valid.
-
-		The mtc_period value is converted to the MTC frequency as:
-
-			CTC-frequency / (2 ^ value)
-
-		e.g. value 3 means one eighth of CTC-frequency
-
-		Where CTC is the hardware crystal clock, the frequency of which
-		can be related to TSC via values provided in cpuid leaf 0x15.
-
-		If an invalid value is entered, the error message
-		will give a list of valid values e.g.
-
-			$ perf record -e intel_pt/mtc_period=15/u uname
-			Invalid mtc_period for intel_pt. Valid values are: 0,3,6,9
-
-		The default value is 3 or the nearest lower value
-		that is supported (0 is always supported).
-
-cyc		Produces CYC timing packets.
-
-		CYC packets provide even finer grain timestamp information than
-		MTC and TSC packets.  A CYC packet contains the number of CPU
-		cycles since the last CYC packet. Unlike MTC and TSC packets,
-		CYC packets are only sent when another packet is also sent.
-
-		Support for this feature is indicated by:
-
-			/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/psb_cyc
-
-		which contains "1" if the feature is supported and
-		"0" otherwise.
-
-		The number of CYC packets produced can be reduced by specifying
-		a threshold - see cyc_thresh below.
-
-cyc_thresh	Specifies how frequently CYC packets are produced - see cyc
-		above for how to determine if CYC packets are supported.
-
-		Valid cyc_thresh values are given by:
-
-			/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/cycle_thresholds
-
-		which contains a hexadecimal value, the bits of which represent
-		valid values e.g. bit 2 set means value 2 is valid.
-
-		The cyc_thresh value represents the minimum number of CPU cycles
-		that must have passed before a CYC packet can be sent.  The
-		number of CPU cycles is:
-
-			2 ^ (value - 1)
-
-		e.g. value 4 means 8 CPU cycles must pass before a CYC packet
-		can be sent.  Note a CYC packet is still only sent when another
-		packet is sent, not at, e.g. every 8 CPU cycles.
-
-		If an invalid value is entered, the error message
-		will give a list of valid values e.g.
-
-			$ perf record -e intel_pt/cyc,cyc_thresh=15/u uname
-			Invalid cyc_thresh for intel_pt. Valid values are: 0-12
-
-		CYC packets are not requested by default.
-
-pt		Specifies pass-through which enables the 'branch' config term.
-
-		The default config selects 'pt' if it is available, so a user will
-		never need to specify this term.
-
-branch		Enable branch tracing.  Branch tracing is enabled by default so to
-		disable branch tracing use 'branch=0'.
-
-		The default config selects 'branch' if it is available.
-
-ptw		Enable PTWRITE packets which are produced when a ptwrite instruction
-		is executed.
-
-		Support for this feature is indicated by:
-
-			/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/ptwrite
-
-		which contains "1" if the feature is supported and
-		"0" otherwise.
-
-		As an alternative, refer to "Emulated PTWRITE" further below.
-
-fup_on_ptw	Enable a FUP packet to follow the PTWRITE packet.  The FUP packet
-		provides the address of the ptwrite instruction.  In the absence of
-		fup_on_ptw, the decoder will use the address of the previous branch
-		if branch tracing is enabled, otherwise the address will be zero.
-		Note that fup_on_ptw will work even when branch tracing is disabled.
-
-pwr_evt		Enable power events.  The power events provide information about
-		changes to the CPU C-state.
-
-		Support for this feature is indicated by:
-
-			/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/power_event_trace
-
-		which contains "1" if the feature is supported and
-		"0" otherwise.
-
-event		Enable Event Trace.  The events provide information about asynchronous
-		events.
-
-		Support for this feature is indicated by:
-
-			/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/event_trace
-
-		which contains "1" if the feature is supported and
-		"0" otherwise.
-
-notnt		Disable TNT packets.  Without TNT packets, it is not possible to walk
-		executable code to reconstruct control flow, however FUP, TIP, TIP.PGE
-		and TIP.PGD packets still indicate asynchronous control flow, and (if
-		return compression is disabled - see noretcomp) return statements.
-		The advantage of eliminating TNT packets is reducing the size of the
-		trace and corresponding tracing overhead.
-
-		Support for this feature is indicated by:
-
-			/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/tnt_disable
-
-		which contains "1" if the feature is supported and
-		"0" otherwise.
+Config terms are parameters specified with the -e intel_pt// event option,
+for example:
+
+	-e intel_pt/cyc/
+
+which selects cycle accurate mode. Each config term can have a value which
+defaults to 1, so the above is the same as:
+
+	-e intel_pt/cyc=1/
+
+Some terms are set by default, so must be set to 0 to turn them off. For
+example, to turn off branch tracing:
+
+	-e intel_pt/branch=0/
+
+Multiple config terms are separated by commas, for example:
+
+	-e intel_pt/cyc,mtc_period=9/
+
+There are also common config terms, see linkperf:perf-record[1] documentation.
+
+Intel PT config terms are described below.
+
+*tsc*::
+Always supported.  Produces TSC timestamp packets to provide
+timing information.  In some cases it is possible to decode
+without timing information, for example a per-thread context
+that does not overlap executable memory maps.

+is produced when a function returns.  Causes more packets to be
+produced but might make decoding more reliable.
++
+The default config does not select noretcomp (i.e. noretcomp=0).
+
+*psb_period*::
+Allows the frequency of PSB packets to be specified.
++
+The PSB packet is a synchronization packet that provides a
+starting point for decoding or recovery from errors.
++
+Support for psb_period is indicated by:
++
+	/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/psb_cyc
++
+which contains "1" if the feature is supported and "0"
+otherwise.
++
+Valid values are given by:
++
+	/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/psb_periods
++
+which contains a hexadecimal value, the bits of which represent
+valid values e.g. bit 2 set means value 2 is valid.
++
+The psb_period value is converted to the approximate number of
+trace bytes between PSB packets as:
++
+	2 ^ (value + 11)
++
+e.g. value 3 means 16KiB bytes between PSBs
++
+If an invalid value is entered, the error message
+will give a list of valid values e.g.
++
+	$ perf record -e intel_pt/psb_period=15/u uname
+	Invalid psb_period for intel_pt. Valid values are: 0-5
++
+If MTC packets are selected, the default config selects a value
+of 3 (i.e. psb_period=3) or the nearest lower value that is
+supported (0 is always supported).  Otherwise the default is 0.
++
+If decoding is expected to be reliable and the buffer is large

+The frequency of MTC packets can also be specified - see
+mtc_period below.
+
+*mtc_period*::
+Specifies how frequently MTC packets are produced - see mtc
+above for how to determine if MTC packets are supported.
++
+Valid values are given by:
++
+	/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/mtc_periods
++
+which contains a hexadecimal value, the bits of which represent
+valid values e.g. bit 2 set means value 2 is valid.
++
+The mtc_period value is converted to the MTC frequency as:
+
+	CTC-frequency / (2 ^ value)
++
+e.g. value 3 means one eighth of CTC-frequency
++
+Where CTC is the hardware crystal clock, the frequency of which
+can be related to TSC via values provided in cpuid leaf 0x15.
++
+If an invalid value is entered, the error message
+will give a list of valid values e.g.
++
+	$ perf record -e intel_pt/mtc_period=15/u uname
+	Invalid mtc_period for intel_pt. Valid values are: 0,3,6,9
++
+The default value is 3 or the nearest lower value
+that is supported (0 is always supported).
+
+*cyc*::
+Produces CYC timing packets.
++
+CYC packets provide even finer grain timestamp information than
+MTC and TSC packets.  A CYC packet contains the number of CPU

++
+	2 ^ (value - 1)
++
+e.g. value 4 means 8 CPU cycles must pass before a CYC packet
+can be sent.  Note a CYC packet is still only sent when another

+Enable a FUP packet to follow the PTWRITE packet.  The FUP packet
+provides the address of the ptwrite instruction.  In the absence of
+fup_on_ptw, the decoder will use the address of the previous branch
+if branch tracing is enabled, otherwise the address will be zero.
+Note that fup_on_ptw will work even when branch tracing is disabled.
+
+*pwr_evt*::
+Enable power events.  The power events provide information about
+changes to the CPU C-state.

+events.

+
+*notnt*::
+Disable TNT packets.  Without TNT packets, it is not possible to walk
+executable code to reconstruct control flow, however FUP, TIP, TIP.PGE
+and TIP.PGD packets still indicate asynchronous control flow, and (if
+return compression is disabled - see noretcomp) return statements.
+The advantage of eliminating TNT packets is reducing the size of the
+trace and corresponding tracing overhead.

+config terms on other events
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+Some Intel PT features work with other events, features such as AUX area sampling
+and PEBS-via-PT.  In those cases, the other events can have config terms below:

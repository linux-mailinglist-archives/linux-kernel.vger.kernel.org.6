If we consider the inheritance approach (prctl + launcher), it's fine until we need to change
THP mode property for several tasks at once, in this case some batch-change approach needed.

if, for example, process_madvise() would support task recursive logic, coupled with kind of
MADV_HUGE + *ITERATE_ALL_VMA*, it would be helpful.
In this case, the orchestration will be much easier.

Don't get us wrong, we're not trying to push this into memcg specifically. 
We're just trying to find a proper/friendly way to control
THP mode for a group of processes (which can be tasks without common parent).

May be if the process grouping logic were decoupled from hierarchical resource control
logic, it could be possible to gather multiple process, and batch-control some task properties.
But it would require to build kind of task properties system, where
a given set of properties can be flexibly assigned to one or more tasks.

Anyway, i think we gonna try alternative
approaches first.(prctl, process_madvise).

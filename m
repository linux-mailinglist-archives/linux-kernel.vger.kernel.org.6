As I've said from a clarity/fragility point of view I'm not happy with
configuring the vector length to one value then immediately doing things
that assume another value, even if everything is actually lined up
in a way that works.  Having uncommented code where you have to go and
check correctness when you see it isn't great, seeing an inconsistency
just raises alarm bells.  It is much clearer to write the code in a way
that makes it obvious that the VL we are using is the one the hardware
is using, for the host save/restore reading the actual VL back seemed
like the most straightforward way to do that.

A similar thing applies with the enumeration code - like I said in reply
to one of Fuad's postings I originally wrote something that's basically
the same as the patch Faud posted but because it is not consistent with
the surrounding code in how it approaches things it was just raising
questions about if the new code was missing something, or if there was
some problem that should be addressed in the existing code.  Rather than
write an extensive changelog and/or comments covering these
considerations it seemed more better to just write the code in a
consistent manner so the questions aren't prompted.  Keeping the
approach consistent is a bit more code right now but makes the result
much easier to reason about.

The late CPUs thing is really just an answer to the initial "why is this
different, what might we have missed?" question rather than a particular
goal itself.  Adding a warning is as much about documenting the handling
of late CPUs as it is about highlighting any unfortunate implementation
choices we run into.

Basically it's maintainability concerns, especially with the enumeration
code.

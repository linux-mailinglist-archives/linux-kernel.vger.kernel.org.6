I run the upstream code (commit 73e931504f8e0d42978bfcda37b323dbbd1afc08)
without this patchset, I see same issue.

perf stat -e "{slots,instructions},cycles,topdown-fe-bound" -a sleep 0.1

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

       262,448,922      slots
        29,630,373      instructions
        43,891,902      cycles
   <not supported>      topdown-fe-bound

       0.150369560 seconds time elapsed

#perf -v
perf version 6.10.rc6.g73e931504f8e

This issue is not caused by this patchset.

Current evlist__cmp() won't really swap the order of cycles and
topdown-fe-bound.

if (lhs_sort_idx != rhs_sort_idx)
        return lhs_sort_idx - rhs_sort_idx;

When comparing cycles and topdown-fe-bound events, lhs_sort_idx is 2 and
rhs_sort_idx is 3, so the swap won't happen.

So the event sequence after sorting is still "slots, instructions ,cycles,
topdown-fe-bound". Both cycles and topdown-fe-bound events won't be placed
into the group.

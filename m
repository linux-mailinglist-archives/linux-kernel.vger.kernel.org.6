Ah, right then we need the boot flag, and my earlier comments to the
parameter apply. I've never used IMA so I don't actually even know in
detail how it is using TPM.

Now that I did some seek I mixed this up with the report:

https://chaos.social/@gromit/113345582873908273

Anyway concerning this issue and patch, my earlier comments still apply.

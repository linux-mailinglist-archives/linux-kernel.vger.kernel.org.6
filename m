I don't remember who it was that asked for the CRC32 long ago=2E It wasn't=
 for Syslinux; it was for an embedded boot loader which didn't have a file =
system=2E=20

I don't know what would break, and it is obviously a mess that the signing=
 protocol didn't take that into consideration, but that is water under the =
bridge, too=2E

We could try zeroing out the CRC field and see if anyone screams=2E=2E=2E

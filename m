Currently we don't have any datasheet or document which is publicly
available, so I will try my best to describe our HW.

Ride is a modular hardware system with several smaller daughter cards
connected to single backplane board and each daughter card is stacked on
top of each other. I will try to explain each daughter card with HW
components and how it is connected to construct the ride-hw.

Backplane board:
  - It contains an MCU (Aurix TC397), CAN/LIN transceiver,
	Audio/GNSS/IMU-I2C signals, Fan header
  - It holds & connects all the daughter cards.

SoC card:
  - It contains:
    - SoM:
      - One of QCS9075M/QCS9100M/QAM8775p SoM.
	  - Each SoM is composed of either qcs9075/qcs9100/sa8775p SoC, along
		with DDR & PMICs.
      - Each SoM can be mounted to same SoC-daughter card of ride-hw.
    - In addition to SoM, it also has
      - 4x UART, 2x USB 3.1 & 1x USB 2.0
      - Memory: 1x OSPI, 2x UFS-3.1
      - Debug: JTAG/QDSS header
      - PCIe0, PCIe1 & Display signals
      - Reset button
  - It is connected to backplain board via B2B connector.

Display card:
  - It contains:
    - 4 eDP ports & 2 DSI-DP bridge
    - I2C GPIO expander & I2C switch
  - It is connected to SoC-card via B2B connector.

Camera card:
  - It contains:
    - 4 Quad DE-serializer, each supporting 4 MIPI CSI inputs
    - Total upto 16 Cameras ports are supported.
  - It is connected to backplain board via B2B connector.

Ethernet card:
  - There are two variants of ethernet card each with different
	capabilities:
    - [Ethernet-v1] card contains:
      - 2x 1G RGMII phy, 2x 1G SGMII phy(enabled currently)
	  - Total 4 phy supported, only 2 phy are enabled and it is used in
		ride.
    - [Ethernet-v2] card contains:
	  - 2x 1G RGMII phy, 2x 2.5G HSGMII(enabled currently) & 10G PCIe based
		MAC+PHY controller
	  - Total 5 phy supported, only 2 phy are enabled and it is used in
		ride-r3.
  - Either [Ethernet-v1] or [Ethernet-v2] is connected to backplain board
	via B2B connector.

PCIe card:
  - It contains:
    - PCIe connections to SoC-card
	- NVME, 2x WLBT module QCA6696/QCA6698 (Wi-Fi & bluetooth solution) &
	  GNSS module
  - It is connected to backplain board via B2B connector & PCIe signals are
	connected to SoC card via flyover cables.

Sensor Card:
  - It contains 3-Axix compass & 6-Axis 3D IMU (accel/gyro) module which
	are communicating via I2C
  - It is connected to backplain board via B2B connector.

Front panel card:
  - It does not contain any active circuitry, only ports are available
    - Audio-in/out ports
    - USB hub ports
    - CAN/LIN ports
    - 12V power off switch
  - It is connected to backplain board via ribbon cable.

Considering outlined h/w description, following are ride configuration
variation each platform supporting:

Between qcs9075, qcs9100 & sa8775p ride/ride-r3 boards, SoM is changing;
And between ride & ride-r3 ethernet is changing.
Excluding these differences all other cards i.e SoC, display, camera, PCIe,
sensor, front & backplain are same and are refactored in ride-common.
If any variant of these cards comes up in future we need to refactor
ride-common accordingly. I will try to outline this as clearly as possible
in next commit log.

Considering current outlines of all daughter cards, following defines
ride/ride-r3 variant boards:
  - sa8775p ride    : QAM8775p SoM + [Ethernet-v1] + other daughter cards
  - sa8775p ride-r3 : QAM8775p SoM + [Ethernet-v2] + other daughter cards
  - qcs9100 ride-r3 : QCS9100M SoM + [Ethernet-v2] + other daughter cards
  - qcs9075 ride-r3 : QCS9075M SoM + [Ethernet-v2] + other daughter cards

Since we don't have a document yet which formally describes
qcs9075/qcs9100 ride board with [Ethernet-v1] card, I shall be dropping
this particular variant in next patch series and re-send after complete
documentation is available.

No the overlay is not a different ride board. This overlay represents
[Ethernet-v2] card which is different than [Ethernet-v1] card.

We thought of using overlay as otherwise we have to create separate board
DTS to support [Ethernet-v2] cards.

Here sa8775p-ride-ethernet-aqr115c.dtso is representing [Ethernet-v2] card.

Our SoM is separate HW which is reusable in ride-hw. Can you share more
details on what we can improve here?


Thanks & regards,

My bad, I'll use x86/sgx: ...

Ok, the goal is to avoid the crash so I'll update the subject line.
That said clearing SGX_EPC_PAGE_RECLAIMER_TRACKED for a page that
cannot be reclaimed seems reasonable on its own.

Ok, I agree part of this explanation is fit for the commit message.
In a busy area of code I don't think every commit touching it should
explain what the code does but here it makes sense.

As a side note with a set of enclaves fighting badly enough for the
EPC memory the probability of an MCE happening inside one of the EWB
operations can become considerable because of the sheer amount of time
spent in them and I don't think anything can be done about it.

That's a good question.  An epc_page can be on one of 3 or 4 lists, or
none, so the logic is already complicated.  My guess is that moving
the page to &node->sgx_poison_page_list only after EREMOVE is done
adds some order, because functionally it doesn't change anything.
(But __sgx_sanitize_pages skips the EREMOVE for poisoned pages)

So epc_page->poison is used temporarily while the page is mapped into
an enclave.  Once the enclave is released a poisoned page is moved to
sgx_poison_page_list.  The current semantics ensure that by that time
the epc_page is not referenced by an encl_page and is not on any other
list so for all purposes it's forgotten.

I don't know.  If we know we cannot reclaim a page should we force the
reclaimer to still look at its flags?

I'm sure we don't want to have to check epc_page->poison multiple
times if we can remove it from a relevant list once. Perhaps it's not
great that my patch adds a period when the epc_page is not on *any*
list, everywhere else this is done only for very short times.  I'm not
sure what it would take to eremove the page earlier so it can be added
to sgx_poison_page_list, I think the "TBD" comment in
arch_memory_failure() refers to that and I hoped to leave it as a TBD.

Best regards

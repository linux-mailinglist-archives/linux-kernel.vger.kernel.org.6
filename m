By the way, another thing I suddenly think of is the percpu cluster
becoming glober over all devices. If one order on the stored si of
percpu cluster is used up, then the whole percpu cluster is drained and
rewritten. Won't this impact performance compared with the old embedding
percpu cluster in each si? In log you said "Ideally non-HDD devices
will be rotated if 2M space has been consumed for each order, this seems
reasonable.", while in reality it may be very difficult to achieve the
'each 2M space has been consumed for each order', but more often happen
when very few of order's space has been consumed, then rewrite percpu.
Wonder what I have missed about this point.

I am trying to understand how this is an ABI problem. Because perf debug
tools could be described as - a best effort based sample collection. All
samples that could be collected for a given perf_event_attr request might
change if the underlying assumptions change later on. AFAICT semantics of
expectations for a given attribute request is not a hard ABI requirement.

BRBE HW does not have any guest filter in itself, unless BRBCR_EL2 gets
migrated across BRBCR_EL1 during guest transition, guest branch records
would not be captured.

event->attr.exclude_guest = 0 could have been denied during armpmu_add()
for preventing events with guest branch sample requests being scheduled
on the PMU. But it turns out to be not a very reliable parameter in that
sense as well.

event->attr.exclude_guest = 0 remains clear even for a standard session.

./perf record -e instructions:k -j any_call,save_type ls

perf tools will need some changes in order to avoid the above scenarios
as a default behaviour which would not be desirable as well.

These semantics could be worked out later on when BRBE guest support gets
included, and the current proposal would not prevent any potential future
changes in this regard.

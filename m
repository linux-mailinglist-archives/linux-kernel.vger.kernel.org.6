Just to make sure that everyone here is one the same page there is
indeed a difference between the ordering of the control resize message
and the kernel implementation; however as this bug has been around for
~15 years the spec should be changed instead, right?

I would like to get a clear ACK of the issue, as I would like to
reference this discussion when creating a bug-report on the virtio-spec
github.

Thanks,
Max

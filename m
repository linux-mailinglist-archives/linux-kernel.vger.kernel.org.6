Right. There can be multiple csses of different subsystems associated 
with each cgroup.

Right now, the patch just keeps a set of simple counters for the total 
number of outstanding csses for each cgroup subsystem. We currently 
doesn't track how many of those csses are associated with dying cgroups. 
That may require iterating all the csses to see if it is attached to a 
dying cgroup or more housekeeping code whenever the state of a cgroup 
changes. So it will burn more CPU cycles.

The current css counts include both live and dying cgroups. As I said 
above, it can be much more work if we want to report only dying csses. 
This information is certainly good to have, but the current counts 
should have provided enough information for an educated guess.

As for the location of this information, I believe it will be easier for 
the users to consume if they are in the same place as nr_descendants and 
nr_dying_descendants.

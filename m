It's on my radar when they release the mini-ITX X870 board over here.
Will need to find the datasheet then.

Why not libsensors?
Access to ACPI and IO ports (without special file capabilities).
Access to the hwmon sysfs ABI in place of libsensors (as libsensors has
no movement at all - not the best reason, I know)

Maybe access to WMI too, but didn't need it in my tests with gigabyte
WMI, as through ACPI you get fan access in addition to temp

I'll clean up something I used in the past and send an RFC for it.

I'm not sure I fully understand the safety concern.

One other option I saw was to have common defines for registers that could
have been shared b/w driver and DTSes. But it looked better to me the way
it has been presented in this series.

In chapter "32.4.2.1 USB/PHY related pins", section "When either Port1 or
Port2 is unused" of the RZ/G3S HW manual it is mentioned "Since USB_VDD18 /
USB_VDD33 are common to 2 Port PHY, it is necessary to supply power even
when one of the
 ports is not in use".

(From the discussions w/ the internal HW team) The PWRRDY is an (software
controlled) indicator to the USB PHY that power supply is ready.

From that and [1] I get that both PHYs are powered by the same regulators
(USB_VDD18/USB_VDD33) and the USB PWRRDY signal need to be set before/after
the USB PHY power off/on. Because of this I consider the order doesn't matter.

That's true. The idea of this implementation was that the consumer would
know what they need to set for themselves on the SYSC side.

We can try, but we can hit the wall again, as the PWRRDY signal is not a
regulator either. From the internal HW discussion is an indicator (software
controlled) that the power to the USB PHY is ready.

That is true.

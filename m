My concerns are not around enabling a CPU, but having a damage control 
with a "kernel" that a user has no control over (Read, standard 
distribution kernel).

1. If the combination of the above causes problem (in Virtualization)
2. If the combination of the above is detected to have problems in 
baremetal.

In (1), VMM could control the ID register and disable the feature.

For (2) we could provide an id-override on command line to disable it in
the worst case.

So, having the id register case is a good way to get the system running
with a given kernel (in either world). Without that, we don't have a 
tunable to control the behavior at runtime.

May be I am being over paranoid about this.

Unfortunately, we can't override to provide the "feature" that is 
missing (at least today).

One option is, run with a whitelist, but provide a kernel parameter to 
disable bbml2 feature.

Something like, arm64.bbml2=0

So the decision is based on the parameter && MIDR list.

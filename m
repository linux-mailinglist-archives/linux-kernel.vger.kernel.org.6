Nah, it's probably just because of the algo string used.
The past few series used caps MEMLAT string instead of
memlat to pass the tuneables, looks like all the laptops
havn't really switched to it yet. Will revert back to
using to lower case memlat so that all devices are
supported. Thanks for trying the series out!

Fairly sure we block persistent in a volatile CFMWS in the kernel.
Any bios actually does this?

You might have a variable partition device but I thought in kernel at
least we decided that no one was building that crazy?

Maybe a QoS split is a better example to motivate one range, two places?

If anyone hits the lock on commit (i.e. annoying BIOS) the ordering
checks on HPA kick in here and restrict flexibility a lot
(assuming I understand them correctly that is)

This is a good illustration of why we should at some point revisit
multiple NUMA nodes per CFMWS.  We have to burn SPA space just
to get nodes.  From a spec point of view all that is needed here
is a single CFMWS.

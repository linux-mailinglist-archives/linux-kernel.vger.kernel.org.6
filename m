Hi Ojaswin,

Sorry for the slow reply, I'm currently on a business trip.

Thank you very much for your test!

The issues in this patch set can all be triggered by injecting EIO or
ENOMEM into ext4_find_extent(). So not only did I test kvm-xftests
several times on x86 to make sure there weren't any regressions,
but I also tested that running kvm-xfstests while randomly injecting
faults into ext4_find_extent() didn't crash the system.

The initial issue was that e2fsck was always reporting some sort of
extents tree exception after testing, so the processes in question
were troubleshooting and hardening, i.e. the first two patches.
The other issues were discovered during fault injection testing of
the processes in question.

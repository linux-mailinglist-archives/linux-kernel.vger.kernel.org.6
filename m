That's pretty unfortunate, I didn't know.

I think for the long term it'd be good to find a way though. Once more and more
subsystems / people start adding Rust code, I could imagine patches to start
slipping through and fixing things up after it's been discovered in -next would
be painful.

Yeah, that's a tricky one; if not enabled by default I'd be a bit worried about
the same thing to happen as mentioned above.

Additionally, for development trees where things slipped through it'd be
annoying when `rustfmt` changes more stuff than expected.

I think that'd be great for short / mid term, it'd make it much easier to ensure
that all relevant checks were executed and hence make it less likely for things
slip through.

For the long term, I think it'd be great to keep looking for ways to always
enable the clippy and format checks. Or at least the clippy ones if we're too
concerned about `rustfmt` to break.

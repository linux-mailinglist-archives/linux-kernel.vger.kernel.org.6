Normally in the SCMI world you could leverage protocol versioning and
the standard PROTOCOL_MESSAGE_ATTRIBUTES(0x2) command to let the agent
investigate if the SCMI server it is speaking to implements or NOT a
specific command and which specific version of that command is understood
(with possibly varying size and fields)...

...BUT since your vendor protocol is 'Generic' and, as it stands, it
basically piggybacks any kind of binary payload (i.e. subcommands of
some kind of subprotocols of yours) into the same 4 get/set/start/stop
'Generic' ops, without even specifying the transmitted/received payload
sizes into the message itself....all of the possible SCMI versioning
autodiscovery and backward-compatibility capabilities happily go out of
the window because:

- your versioning refers to the generic protocol and you cannot possibly
  describe all the possible future subcommands (opaque payloads) variations
  and/or subcommands addition/removals purely on the major/minor version, AND
  even if you did that, NONE of such future variations will be documented
  anywhere since you are hiding all of this inside a bunch of binary blobs

- you dont even specify the payload sizes of the tx/rx 'Generic' payload
  subcommands so it becomes even difficult for both the server and the
  client to safely handle your 'Generic' subcommand message payloads

- you cannot issue a PROTOCOL_MESSAGE_ATTRIBUTE() to see if a specific
  subcommand is supported, because your subcommand is NOT really a protocol
  command but it is just one of the payloads of one of the 'Generic' protocol:
  you commmands are only set/get/start/stop (maybe some sort of hack
  could be doen around these...bit all will be even more flaky...)

- you dont implement NEGOTIATE_PROTOCOL_VERSION and so you cannot even
  check if the SCMI server that you are speaking to will agree to
  downgrade and 'speak' your Kernel SCMI agent (possibly older) 'Generic'
  protocol version

All of this basically defeats all of the SCMI general capabilities
around versioning and auto-discovery when it comes to your 'Generic' vendor
protocol, with the end result that you will have to be EXTREMELY confident
to perfectly match and keep in sync at all times your SCMI Server(FW) and
Client(Kernel) sides, without any possibility of coping with a such a mismatch
on the field by using some of the fallback/downgrade mechanism that you
threw out of the window...
(...and sorry but looking at the above xchange about 'legacy firmware' I am
 a bit skeptic about this as of now :D)

...as I said initially when reviewing this series, you can do whatever
you want within your Vendor protocol, but abusing the SCMI Vendor extensions
capabilities in such a way could end up bringing to the table more cons
(the above) than pros (some supposed 'simplification')

Thanks,
Cristian

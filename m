What is "cryptographically bound". Please go straight to the point and
cut out *all* white paper'ish phrases. We do not need it and will make
painful to backtrack this commit once in the mainline.

Why trusted keys is inside braces. It is not important for the point
you are trying to make here?

Please drop "stateless system" unless you provide a rigid definition
what it is. I have no idea what you mean by it. Probably not that
important, right?

NAK for path for any possible key derivation. They are racy and
and ambiguous.

This should have been in the beginning instead of "some data". What
other implementations exist. For me "this implementation" implies
that this one competing alternative to multiple implementations
of the same thing.

I do not like this science/white paper style at all. Just express
short, open code everything right at start when you need and cut
extras like "stateless system" unless you can provide exact, sound
and unambiguous definiton of it.

Just want to underline how this really needs a complete rewrite with
clear and concise explanation :-) This won't ever work.

What is "key length"? Please refer the exact attribute.

First of all it would be more clear to just s/User id/UID/

And make obvious whether we are talking about ruid or euid and how
this interacts with GIDs.

I'll look at the code change next round if the commit message starts
making any sense.

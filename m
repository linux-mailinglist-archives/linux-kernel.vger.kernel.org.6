I would very strongly rather #2. The problem with #1 is that one of the goa=
ls
with the way I designed this abstraction with was to make it so that we cou=
ld
have lock guards that share the lifetime of the IrqDisabled token - which
means the compiler can stop you from holding the lock outside of an
IrqDisabled context. We have a powerful type system in rust, so IMO we shou=
ld
use it.

I don't think this is as difficult to do as it seems either. One thing we
could do is have two different versions of the with_irqs_disabled functions=
:

with_irqs_disabled_on_nort
with_irqs_disabled

And as well, have each respectively return a different token type:

IrqsDisabledNoRt -> Local interrupts are disabled on non-RT kernels
IrqsDisabled -> Local interrupts are disabled always

I think this actually is a nice solution, because it provides a number of
benefits:

 * It makes it much more clear that interrupts won't always be disabled. I'=
ll
   be honest, I've been working on drivers for almost a decade in the upstr=
eam
   kernel and as you can see I don't think any of us actually realized
   interrupts being turned off here wasn't a given :P. I'm sure it's
   documented, but when you've been working on this stuff for so long you
   don't always default to going back to documentation for stuff like this.
 * Having two different token types would prevent raw spinlocks from being
   used in contexts where it's not guaranteed local IRQs would be disabled =
-
   and vice versa.

FWIW too - that seems reasonable. The reason I still see benefit in with
with_irqs_disabled_on_nort though is that this feels a bit closer to some o=
f
the goals of the C API to me. We have spin_lock_irqsave and spin_lock, with
the intention that on non-RT kernels IRQs should only need to be disabled a
single time even if multiple spinlocks are acquired within the scope of a
single function. I'd like to ensure we can still do that on rust since it's
possible to do.

Not me, but someone in the future could. Regardless:

If this a concern, this is also pretty easy to address by just making
with_irqs_disabled an unsafe function that outlines this in the safety
contract, and leave with_irqs_disabled_nort as a safe function. Then if a u=
ser
is explicitly disabling interrupts anywhere, they have to write an explanat=
ion
as to why as the compiler will complain if they don't. This forces users to
consider why they need to do something like this, and making it very obviou=
s
to reviewers when this is happening and how necessary it is. People are mor=
e
likely to go with the safe function that doesn't require them to document
precisely why they're using it.

We could also look at different names for these functions that move away fr=
om
focusing on interrupts, but still make it clear you're fulfilling a pre-
requisite that's required for specific types of spinlocks.

>=20
> Create explicit interrupt safe interfaces which map to the underlying
> locking primitives instead.

As Benno mentioned this isn't really possible. Primarily for the drop order
reason, but also because the other option to make this map more closely wou=
ld
be to make all SpinLockIrq acquisitions need to happen in unsafe code and
simply document that it's up to the programmer to ensure correct drop order=
.
Then we could make it so that dropping a guard results in turning interrupt=
s
off in no-rt contexts. This initially seems tempting, since we're already
doing this in C! Why not in rust and why reinvent the wheel?

 * We don't want to "dilute" safety contracts. The safety contract of a uns=
afe
   function should be clear and concise, so that it's easy for a reviewer t=
o
   verify and easy for a user to implement. Otherwise, they wouldn't be ver=
y
   useful. I think if we start having introduce safety comments all over th=
e
   place where the safety comment is just "I need to grab a spinlock for th=
is
   interface" - this works against the goals of safety contracts. Requiring
   comments like this at least makes sense to me in the context of acquirin=
g a
   raw spinlock, because then the wording in the safety contract is going t=
o
   end up being focused on "why are you using a raw spinlock here and not a
   normal spinlock"?.
 * Objects with embedded guards are not at all uncommon in rust. Remember w=
e
   have C callbacks that happen under a lock acquired out of our scope, whi=
ch
   we want to be able to implement in rust. And subsequently, we also often
   want methods and data protected under those locks to be accessible by
   explicitly acquiring the lock outside of the context of a callback. The
   most idiomatic way of doing this is to create an object that itself is a
   wrapper around a lock guard, where it is passed via reference to callbac=
ks
   where it is known the lock is acquired (and dropping a ref is a no-op, s=
o
   you can't unlock anything early) and passed by value when it's explicitl=
y
   locked by the users.
   In other words: we'd be asking users not only to handle the drop order o=
f
   explicit Guard objects properly, we'd also be expecting them to do this =
in
   tandem with handling the drop order of such explicitly acquired interfac=
es
   themselves. -And- some functions can even require that you pass a value =
to
   them to relinquish ownership of it, which in the case of guards controll=
ing
   interrupt state would also require the user pay attention to drop order.
   And we're forcing this to be documented on pretty much all of these
   interfaces, when the solution of having a token makes these implications
   visible without having to repeat ourselves in documentation. So it's not
   really as sensible as it would be in C, and would get pretty confusing a=
nd
   difficult to write pretty quickly.

FWIW: I agree we want things to map C closely wherever we can, but part of =
the
reason of having rust in the kernel at all is to take advantage of the
features it provides us that aren't in C - so there's always going to be
differences in some places. This being said though, I'm more then happy to
minimize those as much as possible and explore ways to figure out how to ma=
ke
it so that correctly using these interfaces is as obvious and not-error pro=
ne
as possible. The last thing I want is to encourage bad patterns in drivers
that maintainers have to deal with the headaches of for ages to come,
especially when rust should be able to help with this as opposed to harm :)=

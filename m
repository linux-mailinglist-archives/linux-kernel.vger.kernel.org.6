Yes, please send the first 10 patches separately.

I'd like to have a minimal working version first and then add more
features or convenience on and on.  It should read *some* numbers
from hwmon.

Can the check_alias() part be optional?  I'm not sure how much work is
needed in config_terms() other than setting attr.type for the PMU in the
minimal version.

Yep, these are essential.

I guess this can be in the second patch to improve the behavior.  By
reading the label, it can give the meaning of the numbers in the hwmon.
But it could work without that too, right?

Pleaes keep it minimal to avoid unnecessary work as much as possible.
I think it's needed for maintainers and other contributors to
understand the code and the semantics better.

I appreciate your work on this.

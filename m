Thanks for this! Similar notes to the other patch. On the testing
front, if automation would be possible then new tests would be great.
For example, making sure the sum of topdown metrics is 100%. There are
similar tests for Intel here:

ee/tools/perf/tests/shell/stat_metrics_values.sh?h=3Dperf-tools-next

Thanks,
Ian

My controller driver indeed ties TX to RX and considers the request
completed when the RX completes.

But other drivers can still complete the request at TXDONE if that's
what they need.

I was hoping for a name of a driver, but I guess I can find them out
eventually.

No worries, I'm confident we'll reach a conclusion.

It's true I implemented just my use case, but that doesn't mean that the
"request" approach can't be extended for current users.

If we replace throughout the mailbox core `void *message` with
`struct mbox_request *req`, all the users can still do their magic,
isn't it? The only difference would be that instead of having a
completion structure per channel, we have a completion structure per
request.

In order to have more than one TX in-flight, we need that each TX to
have its own completion struct. Then, for my case, if the clients expect
a response for each TX, then it shall be the responsibility of the
client to allocate space for RX. This is exactly what struct
mbox_request does:

+struct mbox_wait {
+	struct completion completion;
+	int err;
+};
+
+#define DECLARE_MBOX_WAIT(_wait) \
+	struct mbox_wait _wait = { \
+		COMPLETION_INITIALIZER_ONSTACK((_wait).completion), 0 }
+
+#define MBOX_REQ_MAY_SLEEP	BIT(0)
+
+struct mbox_request {
+	struct mbox_wait *wait;
+	void *tx;
+	void *rx;
+	unsigned int txlen;
+	unsigned int rxlen;
+	u32 flags;
+};

Also, in order to have more than one TX in-flight, we need to allow
controller drivers to bypass the mailbox core
one-active-request-at-a-time handling. The current software queue
handling mechanism from the mailbox core can be used as a backlog
mechanism: if the controller driver has no space to process a new
request (regardless if it has hardware queue or not), it can fallback to
the backlog mechanism where one request is handled at a time. The use of
the backlog mechanism shall be an opt-in choice.

Now clients that don't care about RX are allowed to not allocate space
for it, and consider the request completed at TX done, if that's what
they need.

What am I missing?

Thanks,
ta

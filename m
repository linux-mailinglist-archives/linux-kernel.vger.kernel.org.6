Yes please: extend the guard.  drm_dsc_setup_rc_params() supports 8bbp with bpc
of 8, 10, 12, 14 or 16, which are not all supported by DPU (yet?).  Any other
value should be considered an error.

It's worth mentioning, also if the timings / framerate are correct or if there's
any hiccups (common on CMD panels).

It's strange because, as mentioned in a followup patch all the bits in bpc=10
overlap with existing bits in the data field except the lowest bit of data
wasn't getting set even though it should according to downstream sources.  Can
you test [1] and confirm whether "correctly" setting the lowest bit in the data
field doesn't break anything?

Maybe it should be reworded instead.  It's clear that the function will handle
pre-SCR panels, that's why this "type" enum variant is passed.  Perhaps it
should instead explain that DPU (in its current implementation) only supports
pre-SCR panels?

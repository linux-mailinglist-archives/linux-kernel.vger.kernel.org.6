Hi Luto,

My apologies, I missed this response and the active on v11 cause me to 
get an inquiry why I hadn't responded.

Correct, the only entity that can disable PCR banks is the firmware. 
When it initializes the TPM, it can disable banks/algorithms. After 
that, when an extend operation is done, the TPM is expecting an entry 
for all active PCR banks and the TPM itself does the extend hash that is 
stored into the PCRs.

I will chime in here to say that you can't ignore them, but you can send 
a fixed value, either well-known or junk, as the SHA1 value when doing 
the extend operation as you suggest in (e).

Obviously, for the most part, we are in agreement. The one caveat is 
that I don't think the effort to shore-up SHA1 provides a good return on 
the costs it would incur. With no intent to disparage any one person, 
there generally will be two groups that would use SHA1. The first would 
be those limited by their platform and understand the risks. The second 
would be those attempting to do a cryptographic-based security solution 
that has either been living under a rock the last few years or has done 
zero research into the capabilities they are using for their solution. 
IMHO it is better to not inhibit the first group trying to save the 
latter group as the latter are always doomed to failure.

I would be glad to do so, and have tried several ways to explain it. 
Even working with multiple people that understand the problem to draft a 
better explanation. It would be greatly appreciated if you could provide 
what points you think should be clarified to better help convey the 
situation.

While we could have a long discussion over the merits of SMM, the fact 
we have to face is that it is here, and it is not going anywhere any 
time soon. I honestly found AMD's SMM Containerization (Appendix D of 
the AMD64 Architecture Programmer’s Manual - Volume 2) the better 
approach, and it saddens me that it is completely disabled.

no_new_privs is stored per task, not per cred, but that does not change
much.

That makes sense.

My point was to *opportunistically* avoid useless cred allocation in the
case where the thread's old cred is the same as the caller's old cred.
There is no issue with that and it would avoid useless cred duplicates.

Checking the old/current Landlock domains should be a prerequisite
though, and user space would get a specific error code if not all
threads are in the same domain.

...and the creds could also be really read-only:

Yes, let's use the proper API.

I'd really like to avoid blocking all threads because of prepare_creds()
potential errors though.

It would be a lock for Landlock and seccomp operations on one process,
which is OK.

seccomp does it and I think it makes sense and it simplify the use.  It
should be documented though.

So yes, extending the cred API would be an option but maybe not a good
one.

What about a credential hook being used to run the equivalent of the
task_work if a thread tries to change its credential in a racy way?
The hook implementation will check if the group leader of current is
being Landlocked+tsync, and if it is the case, the hook would call
itself the task_work before continuing the execution and letting the
original credential update being applied *after* the Landlock update.
If this happen, the real task_work will just do nothing once it sees
that the Landlock domain is already the new one.

Leveraging the LSM hook to avoid race condition and preparing ahead of
time a set of creds (if not the same as the current one) should enables
Landlock to avoid locking all threads and to avoid any race conditions.

Yes, the initial part of landlock_restrict_self() should be reused as
much as possible in both cases.  The no_new_privs and capability checks
don't need to be duplicated and can stay in landlock_restrict_self().
The task_work would just need to check no_new_privs and call
task_set_no_new_privs(), but without any possible error.  The
prepare_creds() and landlock_merge_ruleset() will be called at least
once but maybe several times, so we can move that in a dedicated helper.

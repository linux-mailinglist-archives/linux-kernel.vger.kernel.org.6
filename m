I understand completely how the Dell naming/numbering scheme is confusing. The shortened version down to just the model number could also be confusing. For example, there is an XPS 9520 as well as a Latitude 9520. The 9 basically translates to "premium" not a specific line of business. For what it is worth, I would prefer the dell-xps13-9345 naming and I think we can have to be mindful to avoid a naming collision in a decade.

Regarding ACPI, hard to tell as I'm not familiar with what's exposed in 
there... there might be legacy / inconsistent things.

For now, I'd suggest to just stick with what we have at the moment and 
build on that. More to the point, have the device tree for xps13-9345 
accepted and derive from it, if / when at some point in time similar 
platforms show up.

Sounds good to me.

On naming, there are ongoing internal discussions to make them more 
coherent.

Apart from that, could you please Cc: us if you plan to submit stuff to 
linux-firmware?

Perhaps then, `x1e80100-dell-tributo-9345` and `dell,tributo-9345` respectively, as this would be the shortest yet most complete description? 'Tributo' already implies its XPS 13" and chassis variation (touchar, hidden trackpad etc etc), '9345' implies XPS 13" of 2024 (?) and in combination with chassis variant pinpoints the model.

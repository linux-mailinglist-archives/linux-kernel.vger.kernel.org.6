Good point, and I took your wording, thank you.

Agreed, use of words like "miscompilation" can annoy people.  What
word would you suggest using instead?

Good point, especially given that I had forgotten about it.

I don't have any immediate ideas for calling attention to this file,
but would the following update be helpful?

+Use of volatile and __data_racy
+-------------------------------

+Adding the volatile keyword to the declaration of a variable causes both

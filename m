Nope. 'ps' uses comm, for example in 'ps -C' which is documented as
"select by command name" and quite commonly used.

It does not use it in the default listing, because it shows "COMMAND",
incl. args, which obviously must use /proc//cmdline. But nobody said
that it does. Kees only mentioned that "ps uses comm for the short
name view of a process", which is true. _You_ wrote about ps and showed
an example with COMMAND which is â€¦ fine, but not really relevant.

If you wanted, you could ask where is comm used by the userspace?
The ones I'm aware of where it's directly visible:
- 'ps -C' or 'ps -o comm'
- pgrep
- top
- htop

Using sourcegraph.com I see mentions in moby, kubernetes, zsh and
ohmyzsh, earlyoom, vmtop, and pages of more obscure stuff. It's also
exposed via libsystemd's sd_bus_creds and journald's _COMM field.
The generic interfaces are the biggest problem. We could probably
update top/htop/pgrep to use argv[0], but we can't fix scripts
that are out there that either use 'ps -o comm' or look in /proc//comm
directly or filter journalctl output by field.

As mentioned, this is easily disproved by running e.g. top/htop/pgrep.

Exactly.

You keep disagreeing with things that nobody has said.

The point is that comm _is_ used in many places that matter. I'm not
sure what you're trying to say really, since in the second half of
your mail you actually showed an example where this is true.

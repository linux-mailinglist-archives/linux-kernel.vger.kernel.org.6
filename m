You claimed this a couple of times here and on IRC, but sincerely,
looking at the fastchannel implementation in SCMI core and Perf, I could
not track down where this could have happened in the recent code
(i.e. with or without your recent, welcomed, patches...)

When FC initialization fails and bailout it says:
	
	"Failed to get FC for protocol %X [MSG_ID:%u / RES_ID:%u] - ret:%d. Using regular messaging."

... and it clears any gathered address for that FC, so that in __scmi_perf_level_get()
you end up skipping the FC machinery and use messaging

	if (dom->fc_info && dom->fc_info[PERF_FC_LEVEL].get_addr) {
		...
	}

	return scmi_perf_msg_level_get(ph, dom->id, level, poll);

Now this is done ONLY for the FC that specifically failed
initialization, i.e. identified by the tuple PROTO_ID/MSG_ID/RES_ID
(as stated in the noisy message above where MSG_ID is specified) NOT for
all Fastchannel, so you can have an FC successfully initialized only on
the GET but failing in the SET, so only the GET FC will be used.

I dont really understand how the Kernel was misbehaving and using
instead stale data, neither, if this was the case, I can see where this
issue would have been fixed.

To be clear, I am not really interested in throwing an argument here, but
I sincerely dont see where the alleged problem was and how was fixed (kernel
side), so I fear it could be still there, hidden maybe by a change in the
platform fw.

Apologies if I missed something along the history of this..

Thanks,
Cristian

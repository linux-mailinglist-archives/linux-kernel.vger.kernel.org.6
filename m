Odd.  How is this any different than what is going to happen for
platform or other drivers of any other type?  Sometimes they want to
only create one single "static" object and register it with the bus they
are assigned to.

Do we need to have a RuscMiscDevice object somewhere instead that
doesn't care about the module logic at all?  And then just use a
"normal" rust module object to create a single instance of that which
the misc binding will handle?

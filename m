It took me some time to understand the actual problem (yeah I know...)

Can this be rephrased as: "Timer and hrtimer softirq vectors are special
in that they are always raised in-IRQ context whereas other vectors are
more likely to be raised from threaded interrupts or any regular tasks
when threaded interrupts or PREEMPT_RT are enabled. This leads to
waking ksoftirqd for the processing of the softirqs whenever timer
vectors are involved.

But for ksoftirqd to collect other non-timers softirqs, those vectors must
have been raised before from a threaded interrupt, right? So why those
vectors didn't get a chance to execute at the end of that threaded interrupt?

OTOH one problem I can imagine is a threaded interrupt preempting ksoftirqd
which must wait for ksoftirqd to complete due to the local_bh_disable()
in the beginning of irq_forced_thread_fn(). But then isn't there some
PI involved on the local lock?

Sorry I'm probably missing something...

That last sentence confuses me. How are timers for non regular task processed
elsewhere? Ah you mean RT tasks rely on hard hrtimers?

This needs a comment section to explain why a dedicated
timers processing is needed.

Let's align with local_softirq_pending() naming and rather
have local_timers_pending() ?

That also needs a comment.

This is supposed to be called from hardirq only, right?
Can't irq_exit_rcu() take care of it? Why is it different
from HRTIMER_SOFTIRQ ?

Thanks.

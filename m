Do you mean that the kernel should reject that, or that userspace should
reject that.

As mentioned earlier, I am ok with the idea that we reject *scheduling*
events with mismatched filters, as we do for other resource conflicts.
That would necessarily mean rejecting *groups* of events with
inconsistent filters at open time.

However, I do not think that we should reject indepenent events which
happen to have mismatched filters, regardless of whether they're opened
by the same "session".

I generally agree, but IIRC userspace does this today.

No. We are not going to expose *dynamic* information about the PMU
hardware via sysfs. This is not as simple as you make it out to be.
At any point in time there can be an arbitrary number of events open,
and some arbitrary subset currently scheduled.

I agree that ideally this should be rare, though, and hence either of
the two options I have suggested thus far should handle that acceptably.

I hate to repeat myself, but the driver has *no concept whatsoever* of a
"session". It only knows:

* Which events are currently active in hardware.

* Which events have been grouped together.

* Which events have been opened for a given task or CPU context.

... and *NONE* of those correspond directly to a "session" managed by
the userspace perf tool.

Cool, sounds like we could do that then!

Sorry, as above, that is not going to happen. It is not practical and
will cause many other problems.

What specifically are you proposing to prototype?

Mark.

I suspect it would require some work on perfetto trace-processor.  It
can ingest ftrace events (but those would end up being something
driver specific).  Maybe with u_trace and some tracepoints in the
'ambles something could be done that would be more driver agnostic
(but idk if that would work for gpu's where preemption happens more
autonomously in the fw)

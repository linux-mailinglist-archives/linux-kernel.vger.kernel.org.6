I confused myself as well I think. I am talking about (1). Let me try
again.

If we support `NOARG_ALLOWED` (`KERNEL_PARAM_OPS_FL_NOARG` in C. I
should change the flag name in Rust), modules can optionally support
some parameters where users can pass parameters either as
`my_module.param=3Dvalue` or `my_module.param`. Thus, at the level of
`try_from_param_arg`, we need to represent two cases: parameter passed
without value, and parameter passed with value. A third case, parameter
not passed at all, is equivalent to `try_from_param_arg` never being
called. In C this is undetectable for the predefined parameter types. I
wanted the double option to detect this. But I guess it does not make
sense.

At a higher level where the bindings supply the parsing functions, we
can decide that passing an argument without a value yields a default
parameter value. C does this for the predefined `bool` type. The
predefined integer types does not support omitting the value.

This patch only supports the higher level predefined parameter types,
and does not allow modules to supply their own parameter parsing
functions. None of the types we implement in this patch support passing
the argument without a value. This is intentional to mirror the C
implementation.

To that end, I removed `NOARG_ALLOWED`, and changed the parsing function
trait to:

    fn try_from_param_arg(arg: &'static [u8]) -> Result<Self>;

If/when we start supporting types like `bool` or custom parsing
functions provided by the module, we will have to update the signature
to take an `Option` to represent the case where the user passed an
argument without a value. However, to mimic C, the function must always
return a value if successful, even if the user did not supply a value to
the argument.

Two different default values are in flight here. 1) the value that the
parameter will have before the kernel calls `try_from_param_arg` via
`set_param` and 2) the value to return from `try_from_param_arg` if the
user did not pass a value with the argument.

For a `bool` 1) would usually be `false` and 2) would always be `true`.

For predefined types the module would not customize 2), but 1) is useful
to customize. For custom types where the module supplies the parsing
function, 2) would be implicitly given by the module in the parsing
function.

In this patch set, we only have 1 default value, namely 1). We do not
need 2) because we do not support parameters without values.

The current patch uses the default value given in the `module!` macro to
initialize the parameter value.

We should plan on eventually supporting `String`.

I just don't see the point. Just have the user pass `my_module.param=3D1`
instead of omitting the value. Having multiple ways of specifying for
instance a true boolean just leads to confusion. Some boolean parameters
have a default value of `true`, for instance `nvme.use_cmb_sqes`. In
this case specifying `nvme.use_cmb_sqes` has no effect, even though one
might think it has.

Of course, if we are going to do things the same as C, we have to
support it.

Right. I agree the right thing is to change to `addr_of_mut!`. But I am
curious. If the original code was

```rust
arg: unsafe {{ &mut __{name}_{param_name}_value }} as *mut _ as *mut ::core=
::ffi::c_void,
```

Then it would be fine? Because we have the only mutable reference in
existence when the code is evaluated.

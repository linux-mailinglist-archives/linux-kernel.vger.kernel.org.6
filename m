Okay, will replace with the original paragraph.

Done.

branch_context tracks event->ctx which is 'struct perf_event_context *'. The
'void *' seemed more generic in case this tracking structure changes later.
But this could be changed as 'struct perf_event_context *' if required.

branch_sample_type is applicable both for cpu and task bound events, where as
branch_context is applicable only for task bound events tracking their active
branch records that need to be dropped (or saved), in case a cpu bound event
comes in.

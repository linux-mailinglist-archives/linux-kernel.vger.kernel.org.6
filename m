I would like to share details with example:
Say in SoC we have 3 clusters S(small), M(Medium) and L(large) and all 
three clusters shares L3 as LLC.
Say on UFS with MCQ, most of the submission would be done from M 
clusters. So SQ's CPUs would be mostly bounded to M clusters. Now if we 
assign ESI IRQ for CQ on same M cluster cpu, these CPU's gets overloaded 
with SQ and IRQ bounded with that CQ ( IRQn <->CQn). So we intentionally 
want to affine IRQn <-> CQn on large clusters as LLC is shared, so we 
don't need IPI.
Earlier below code was working like blk_mq_complete_need_ipi() returning 
false and hence blk_mq_complete_request() returs false. Thus we complete 
CQ of M clusters on L clusters CPU in HardIRQ context and get better 
Perf numbers.

blk_mq_complete_need_ipi()
	/* same CPU or cache domain and capacity?  Complete locally */
	if (cpu == rq->mq_ctx->cpu ||
	    (!test_bit(QUEUE_FLAG_SAME_FORCE, &rq->q->queue_flags) &&
	     cpus_share_cache(cpu, rq->mq_ctx->cpu))
		return false;

void blk_mq_complete_request(struct request *rq)
{
	if (!blk_mq_complete_request_remote(rq))  --> true,
		rq->q->mq_ops->complete(rq);   --> execute here
}

But now with addition of cpus_equal_capacity(cpu, rq->mq_ctx->cpu)
blk_mq_complete_need_ipi() would try for IPI. Further 
blk_mq_complete_request_remote() would be true and hence
__blk_mq_complete_request_remote() would complete the request in SOFTIRQ 
context, which would cause low performance due to context switching.

Not all the SoCs implements L3 as shared LLC. There are SoCs with L2 as 
LLC and not shared among all CPU clusters. So in this case, if we use 
rq=0, this would force to use a CPU, which doesn't shares L2 cache.
Say in a system cpu[0-5] shares L2 as LLC and cpu[6-7] shares L2 as LLC, 
then any request from CPU[0-5] / CPU[6-7] would force to serve IRQ on 
CPUs which actually doesn't shares cache, would would result low 
performance.

So basically the change enforces to use SOFTIRQs for completing the IO 
requests, which could have been completed in HardIRQ context itself and 
this affects more to MCQ devices.

For Non MCQ devices, there is a case,where we can can use Low capacity 
CPUs for completing the request (handling IRQs on S CPUs) to save Power 
and avoiding wakeup of all CPUs of same capacity in order to submit and 
complete the IO requests.

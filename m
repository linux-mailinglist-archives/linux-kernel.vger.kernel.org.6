No need to skip the test, I'll take this one [1]. I think we're on the
same page that it's probably a test or cosmetic issue rather than
anything being broken in Perf.

I wouldn't read into it too much, I think this is just a courtesy email
pointing out that we're aware of an issue and tracked it back to a
particular commit. I don't think there is any expectation that it has to
be you that makes the fix and I'm happy to look into it.

As I mentioned in that thread I'll fix that one too at some point, I'm
just finishing off some other stuff first.

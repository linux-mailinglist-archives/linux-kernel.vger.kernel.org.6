That is my understanding, and I agree with them and with you.

I don't see them as "legacy".

That is my understanding of the original intent, yes.

A first approximation, those who want to dig deeper, well, learn more
about the architecture, learn about the extensive support for
vendor/JSON events, sysfs ones, how to properly configure them taking
advantage of the high level of flexibility both perf, the tool and perf
the kernel subsystem allows them to be used, in groups, leader sampling,
multiplexing or not, etc.

But lots of developers seem to be OK with just the default events or
using those aliases for expected events across architectures, sometimes
specifying :ppp as a hint that if there are more precise events in this
architecture, please use them, for instance.

And adding special case for broken things when we know that some event
named "cycles" shouldn't be used for sampling, for instance.

Right. And again, if something doesn't work for a while in some
architecture, its just a matter of specifying the name of the event in
full form, with the PMU prefix, etc.

Indeed.

Yes, and work in this area is greatly appreciated.

Sure, will add that.

Ahh, that was my bad, completely missed.

Agreed, will change ABLE as FTR_NONSTRICT instead.

But what about the ID_AA64DFR0_EL1_WRPs_SHIFT and ID_AA64DFR0_EL1_BRPs_SHIFT
which could have variations in different cpus on the same system ? So should
those be fixed as FTR_NONSTRICT first ?

I have posted V2 for this series earlier today, hence will accommodate all the
new comments here in V3 going forward.

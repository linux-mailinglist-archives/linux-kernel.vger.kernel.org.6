Hi Arnaldo,

In one of your investigations here 
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/Zld3dlJHjFMFG02v@x1/ comparing "cycles", 
"cpu-cycles" and "cpu_cycles" events on Arm you say only some of them 
open events on both core types. I wasn't able to reproduce that on 
perf-tools-next (27ac597c0e) or v6.9 (a38297e3fb) for perf record or 
stat. I guessed the 6.9 tag because you only mentioned it was on tip and 
it was 29th May. For me they all open exactly the same two legacy events 
with the extended type ID set.

It looks like the behavior you see would be caused by either missing 
this kernel change:

   5c81672865 ("arm_pmu: Add PERF_PMU_CAP_EXTENDED_HW_TYPE capability")
    (v6.6 release)

Or this userspace change, but unlikely as it was a fix for Apple M hardware:

   25412c036 ("perf print-events: make is_event_supported() more robust")
    (v6.9 release)

Do you remember if you were using a new kernel or only testing a new 
Perf? Or if you don't mind could you re-test? Hopefully not to derail 
the discussion but I just want to make sure I'm not missing some other 
third issue before I start hacking away.

I believe we still need to revert the revert of the JSON/legacy change. 
Because as Mark mentions there is no guarantee that a PMU's named event 
is the same as a legacy event of the same name, so we do want to prefer 
sysfs/JSON. There are some other edge cases like new Perf on an old 
kernel before we added extended type support, but I don't think I'll 
list all of them.

Having said that, I believe that currently all the sysfs and legacy 
events actually _are_ the same. So it's not a user facing issue _yet_, 
or at least on any hardware mentioned in these threads.

Thanks
James

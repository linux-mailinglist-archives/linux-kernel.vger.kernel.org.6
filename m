Because MCE handler will call printk() before call the panic, so 
printk() deadlock may happen in this scenario:

CPU A                            CPU B
printk()
   lock(console_owner_lock)
                                  exc_machine_check_user()
                                    irqentry_enter_from_user_mode()
exc_machine_check_kernel()         do_machine_check()
   irqentry_nmi_enter()               mce_panic()
   do_machine_check()                 printk_mce()  #A
     mce_panic()                      ...
       wait_for_panic()               panic()

printk deadlock will happened at #A because in_nmi() evaluates to false 
on CPU B and CPU B do not enter the panic() AT #A.

Update user space MCE handler to NMI class context is preferred?

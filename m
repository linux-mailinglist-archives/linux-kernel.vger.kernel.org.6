I think we need a more nuanced rule there.

When you're rolling out something new of a nontrivial size, you always
want to stage the release. You don't want everyone to start using
10k-100k lines of new code at once, you want it to first hit your power
users that can debug - and maybe the new thing isn't feature complete
yet.

If a big driver is being rewritten in Rust (e.g. if we went all the way
with the nvme driver; that was one of the first prototypes) I would want
and expect that we ship both in parallel for a few cycles and make sure
the new one is working for everyone before deleting the old one.

And tends to be what we do in practice, where appropriate. blk-mq was
incrementally rolled out. No one's even contemplating ripping out
fs/aio.c and replacing it with an io_uring wrapper.

Wholesale rewrites of entire subsystems in the kernel are rare (because
we can refactor), but with Rust we'll be seeing more and more of that -
because most of the really tricky safety sandmines do occur at FFI
boundaries.

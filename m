If a change occurs because a recent change happened that allows the
current change to work, then I think a Depends-on is appropriate.

Like in this example. I thought this change was broken, and it would
have been except for a recent change. Having the dependency listed is
useful, especially if the dependency is subtle (doesn't break the build
and may not show the bug immediately).

The intended audience is someone backporting features and not fixes.

How would you see it going out of control? And "Depends-on" would only
be used for non stable relationships. If stable backports, we can keep
with the current method.

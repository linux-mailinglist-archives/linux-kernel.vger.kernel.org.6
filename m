I think fpga manager could do something with the helper of HW and image
builder. If the region identifier could be read out from some HW
registers on fpga_region enumeration, and it is also built into the
image header, the fpga manager could check the validity.

Some reprograming engine even enforce the validation by requiring SW
input region identifier along with the image data.

Without the help of HW, I cannot see any SW solution could help, one
interface per region or one interface per engine.

Thanks,
Yilun

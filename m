Let me give my personal take. This seems like a stopgap or a quick hack
to resolve the very specific situation happening in real world. I am ok
with having this solution but only temporarily. The reason why I think
this is short term fix or a quick hack is because it is not specifically
solving the fundamental issue here. The same situation can reoccur if
let's say the swap storage was slow or stuck or contended. A somewhat
similar situation is when there are lot of unreclaimable memory either
through pinning or maybe mlock.

The fundamental issue is that the exiting process (killed by oomd or
simple exit) has to allocated memory but the cgroup is at limit and the
reclaim is very very slow.

I can see attacking this issue with multiple angles. Some mixture of
reusing kernel's oom reaper and some buffer to allow the exiting process
to go over the limit. Let's brainstorm and explore this direction.

In the meantime, I think we can have this stopgap solution.

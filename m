Hello,


I just realized that I made a typo to recipients field for DAMON mailing list.
As a result, the original news letter has not saved on DAMON maling list
archive.  Forwarding the news letter again with correct recipients fields,
since being late is better than nothing in my opinion.


Thanks,
SJ

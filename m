You're right that it isn't. The thing that is specific to rust here, in
my opinion, is the scale. It's a bigger coordinated effort, compared to
drive-by contributors trying to rush a driver in, or an API change. Due
to the scale difference I understand that many people can get frightened
(for good or bad reasons, that's not my point) more easily by R4L.

The upsides you've listed here are pretty much undisputed, although the
scale at which they may improve the kernel is still being debated. I
personally think we have lots of room for improvement in the C APIs too.
Many misuses can't be caught by the compiler due to the nature of the
language, and intentional misuse can't really be easily prevented
either, but we can do a much better job at creating APIs that are a)
*possible* to use correctly, and b) *easy* to use correctly. That would
already be a large improvement in many cases. My first rule of API
design is "if I had to guess how this works without reading
documentation, would my guess be likely right?".

I strongly believe that some of the API design principles enforced by a
rust compiler, especially related to life-time management of objects,
will over time improve C APIs. As a larger number of kernel developers
understand important concepts, API quality will improve. That doesn't
necessarily even require learning rust, I know that my C API design
skills improved when I learnt how to use C++ correctly (post-C++11).

I wouldn't consider slow progress as a sign the experiment is failing to
deliver. There are lots of hurdles to overcome before seeing large
gains. I however understand how, due to this, some people can still be
skeptical of the ability of rust to bring large improvements to the
kernel. As you said, it's a catch 22. I'm not concerned about this
though, it's only a matter of pace. If the experiment can deliver and be
successful, I expect more people to get on board with an exponential
increase.

Yes, I understand that feeling. I think I can actually understand both
sides.

Having contributed to the kernel for a couple of decades now, and
maintaining different bits and pieces both in drivers and core subsystem
code, I'm well aware of how scary large changes can be when they are
perceived as very disruptive. This could be seen as just a case of
conservatism, or an attempt by some maintainers to preserve their job
security, but I think that wouldn't reflect reality in many cases. I
believe we have kernel developers and maintainers who are scared that
rust in their subsystem will make it more difficult, or even prevent
them, from doing a good job and from providing good service to their
users. Even if this turns out to be unfounded fears, the *feeling* is
there, and a lot of the recent drama is caused more by feeling and
emotions than objective facts.

On the flip side, I've struggled multiple times to get changes accepted
in the kernel (purely on the C side, pre-dating rust) that I felt were
right and needed, facing maintainers (and even whole subsystem
communities) who I believe just didn't understand. In some cases it took
lots of energy to get code merged, sometimes having to rewrite it in
ways that made no sense to me, and in some cases I just gave up.
Sometimes, years later, the maintainers and communities realized by
themselves that I was actually right all along. Sometimes I was wrong,
and sometimes there was no real right and wrong. I assume many rust for
Linux developers feel in a similar way, trying to do what they believe
is right for everybody (I generally don't assume bad faith, with a
fairly high threshold before considering I've been proven otherwise),
and just encountering hard walls. I know how demotivating it can be.

I overall agree with that, and that's true even without considering rust
at all. It's also a bit hard to blame someone who won't take time to
listen to your plans about how to redo the foundations of their house
when they're busy fighting the roof on fire, but in any case it's not
sustainable. Some areas of the kernel are faring better than others, and
it may not be a surprise that DRM, having improved their sustainability
with a successful multi-committers model, is one of the most
rust-friendly subsystems in the kernel.

The fact that we're talking about maintainer burnout as normal speaks
volumes. It's a widespread mental health issue, and it became our
routine. I want to write that in an industry where workers die like
flies this would raise an alarm and call for changes, but ... Still,
this should *not* be considered normal.

And I fully agree about the social impact, I think this partly explains
why the kernel community is considered by many as highly toxic, while
lots of other people see it as being nice and friendly.

This circles back to the yak shaving question I initially asked. I can't
tell how reasonable it would be for a maintainer to ask rust-for-Linux
developers to help with the burning roof first, before talking about the
redesign of the foundations. I think any rust contributor who wouldn't
want to invest lots of time fixing a subsystem first should be judged
negatively, but the push back can then also be understood.

The last point I'd like to emphasize is that helping with core subsystem
issues could be an effective way to restore trust that got eroded over
time between the C and rust camps. I'd be more likely to trust with my
house keys someone who helped me save my roof from fire.

Suppose we have this artificial online set:

NODE 0 -> CPU 0
NODE 1 -> CPU 1
NODE 2 -> CPU 2

And we have nohz_full=1,2

So there is kswapd/2 that is affine to NODE 2 and thus CPU 2 for now.

Now CPU 2 goes offline. The scheduler migrates off all
tasks. select_fallback_rq() for kswapd/2 doesn't find a suitable CPU
to run to so it affines kswapd/2 to all remaining online CPUs (CPU 0, CPU 1)
(see the "No more Mr. Nice Guy" comment).

But CPU 1 is nohz_full, so kswapd/2 could run on that isolated CPU. Unless we
handle things before, like this patchset does.

And note that adding isolcpus=domain,1,2 or setting 1,2 as isolated
cpuset partition (like most isolated workloads should do) is not helping
here. And I'm not sure this last resort scheduler code is the right place
to handle isolated cpumasks.

So it looks necessary, unless I am missing something else?

And that is just for reaffine on CPU down. CPU up needs mirroring treatment
and also it must handle new CPUs freshly added to a node.

Thanks.

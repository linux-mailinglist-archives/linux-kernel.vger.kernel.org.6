It's sad that it is coming to this, but I have to second Eric here:
for CPU based crypto, the flexibility of Herbert's approach has no
added value. SHA CPU instructions can be interleaved at the
instruction level to get almost 2x speedup in some cases, and this
works very well when operating on equal sized inputs. However,
generalizing this to arbitrary request chains to accommodate async h/w
offload introduces a lot of complexity for use cases that are only
imaginary.

Given Eric's track record as a contributor to the crypto subsystem and
as a maintainer of subsystems that are closely tied to it, I would
expect Herbert to take his opinion more seriously, but it is just
being ignored. Instead, a lightly tested alternative with no
integration into existing users has been merged in its place, with
very little input from the community.

So Herbert, please withdraw this pull request, and work with Eric and
the rest of us to converge on something that we can all get behind.

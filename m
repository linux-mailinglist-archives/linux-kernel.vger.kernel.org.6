Both is true.

a) panels need a lot more ordering than what the pm core provides

b) we still need to make sure that all the _other_ things the pm core
manages (like power/clock domains) don't get shut down too early

If the panel is gone, there's no point in the drm driver calling unprepare
and disable in the right order, the thing is off already.

So yeah defacto this means:
- panel and bridge drivers should _not_ put anything that manages drm kms
  state into their pm callbacks. None of them. The only stuff they can do
  in there is essentially undo anything they do in ->probe. But then I
  have questions why they're wasting power even when not in use ...

- drm driver must be in charge of the entire sequence, and the
  panel/bridge drivers must do any pm management in their kms callbacks

- but we still need to make sure that the pm core doesn't shut down the
  panel/bridges too early, because there's parent resources that the pm
  core manages for us (and they might be entirely disjoint from the
  display device, e.g. if your panel is on an i2c bus, then that i2c must
  stay powered on until after the drm device has done the pm handling)

Nah, still the same order like in a more separate panel driver:

- Whatever physical bus driver the panel sits on is the parent bus for the
  panel. Whether that's i2c, spi, dsi or dp aux kinda doesn't matter.

- The panel driver provides the panel for the drm_device. Note that
  drm_device is does have a struct device pointer, but that's just for
  nesting/linking/userspace device enumeration. There's _no_ pm
  relationship between the two

- It's up to the drm driver to figure out how to make sure it's shuts down
  the software drm_device _before_ any of the hardware pieces go away. For
  pci drivers this is usually pretty easy, for anything else you need a
  device link or it'll go wrong in corner cases.

Yes. And I think for buses like the mipi dsi one we really should have
that. And indeed, we do:

struct mipi_dsi_device {
	struct mipi_dsi_host *host;
	struct device dev;

	...

So it all checks out.

The edp case is special because we don't need per-panel edp drivers,
because it's all specialized. Therefore the full driver model with a
full-blown struct device is overkill. But conceptually, it should be
there.

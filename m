How progressed is this shrinker? It would be good to have an RFC so that
we can look to see how user submission could fit in with it.

User submission requires a cooperating user space[1]. So obviously user
space would need to ensure any BOs that it expects will be accessed to
be in some way pinned. Since the expectation of user space submission is
that we're reducing kernel involvement, I'd also expect these to be
fairly long-term pins.

[1] Obviously with a timer to kill things from a malicious user space.

The (closed) 'kbase' driver has a shrinker but is only used on a subset
of memory and it's up to user space to ensure that it keeps the relevant
parts pinned (or more specifically not marking them to be discarded if
there's memory pressure). Not that I think we should be taking it's
model as a reference here.

As you say the granularity of pinning has to be fairly coarse for user
space submission to make sense. My assumption (could be wildly wrong)
was that most memory would be pinned whenever a context is rendering.

I'm not entirely sure I follow how this doesn't create a dependency
cycle. From your description it sounds like you create a fence from the
user space queue which is then used to prevent eviction of the BOs needed.

So to me it sounds like:

1. Attach fence to BOs to prevent eviction.

2. User space submits work to the ring buffer, rings doorbell.

3. Call into the kernel to create the fence for step 1.

Which is obviously broken. What am I missing?

One other thing to note is that Mali doesn't have local memory - so the
only benefit of unpinning is if we want to swap to disk (or zram etc).

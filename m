Yeah that sounds like *the* prototypical case of sharing memory with an 
untrusted third party.

There is no such thing as "confined UB". Well, there is "poison data", which can 
act a bit like that, but sadly the C standard is extremely ambiguous on that 
subject and has been for decades despite repeated requests for clarifications, 
so it is entirely unclear whether and how "poison data" could exist in C. clang, 
for once, has decided that "poison data" is UB in most situations (including 
just copying it to / returning it from another function), and this is consistent 
with some of the messaging of the standards committee. I don't know enough about 
the internals of gcc to comment on what they do.

Personally, I think that's a mistake; there needs to be some clear way to deal 
with uninitialized memory (which is the typical example of "poison data").

In Rust we have a fairly clear idea of what our rules should be here, and you 
can have "poison data" inside the `MaybeUninit` type. However, neither Rust nor 
C have a way to do reads where data races cause "poison data" rather than UB. 
See my other email I just sent for the rest of this line of discussion.
(I'm not used to the sprawling tree of a discussion that is this mailing list, 
so not sure how to best deal with replies that want to "merge" things said in 
different emails.)

Kind regards,
Ralf

I wasn't worried about the ACTLR register, but the PRR_CFG_*ADDR regs ;-)

IIRC those were in the SMMU global space, why hyp tends to like to own.

tbh, I don't think there is anything better or worse about having the
reserved-memory node vs dynamically allocating it.  (If we dynamically
allocate, we should remove the reserved memory node from
x1e80100.dtsi)

The thing I was more concerned about was whether there was any chance
that some existing or future SoC+fw combo _relied_ on a reserved
memory node and the fw programming PRR_CFG_*ADDR.  If there was any
chance of that, and we went the dynamic allocation route, then we'd
have some devices with a reserved memory node, and some without.  That
seems a bit ugly to me.

If there is no chance of this, then we can go either route.

I guess if it is all mmu-500, then we can just pick based on compat
string.  If it turns out some subset of smmu-v2 have PRR, we can just
have a list of compat strings in arm-smmu-qcom.c.. there would only be
a finite # of them ;-)

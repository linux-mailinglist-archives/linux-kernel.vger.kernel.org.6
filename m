Dropping FAST does not really address the problem here. These keys are
being treated as a bitmap when they are in fact just values. Because
they are currently treated as bitmaps, it is semantically acceptable to
"or" two of the keys together and pass them into hwprobe. Dropping FAST
from the input of EMULATED | SLOW will make it appear to work, but it is
not reasonable to try to support or'ing of values that are not bitmaps. If a
key that maps to a value of 5 is ever introduced, then the input of
UNSUPPORTED | EMULATED will also return cpus that map to the new key.
If hwprobe recieves a value of 3 for CPUPERF_0 and or'ing is supported,
that could either be interpreted that the user is asking for cpus that are
EMULATED or SLOW or FAST, or just FAST, or just EMULATED or SLOW. The
current implementation defines that only FAST will be returned because
or'ing values like this is nonsense.

Allowing an input where keys are or'd together should not be supported
in CPUPERF_0 since it is what is causing this issue. However, the
original intent seems to be to allow an or'ing of keys. The verbosity of
using CPUPERF_0 will be greatly increased without the ability to or keys
together. If an application wants to know if misaligned accesses are
supported, it currently needs 3 separate hwprobe calls, one for each
EMULATED, SLOW, and FAST. Changing CPUPERF_0 to be a true bitmap would
require changing the values of each of the existing keys which is not an
acceptable API change.

In my previous email I proposed a new key, which could be something like
RISCV_HWPROBE_KEY_CPUPERF_1, that is actually a bitmap. That way a query
of EMULATED | SLOW | FAST would be possible in a single hwprobe call,
which seems to be the original intent of CPUPERF_0.

I understand your concern.

Sometimes, users might ask if the data source is supported in Arm SPE. With exposing
the LDS bit, it would be helpful for us to check if the feature is supported. For
example, when a user uses the perf tool to record Arm SPE data, the LDS bit is stored
in the perf metadata, and we can check its value during post-analysis.

We can live without exposing LDS bit currently. I will drop this change in next spin.

Just head up, later I think we might still need to expose capacity bits (or the
PMSIDR_EL1 register) for new features. As you said, we can do it when it is necessary.

Thanks for suggestion!

I received a concern about a corner case of the metric (positive access check
samples ratio) offline.  In short, DAMON might find a few discontiguous
extremely hot and small regions and let those achieve the target positive
access check samples ratio, even with very short aggregation interval.

I was able to show the corner case indeed.  It started to increase the
aggregatiopn interval at the beginning, but it gets reduced as time goes by and
region boundaries get converged.  It was showing a few very hot 4-8 KiB memory
regions that showing maximum nr_accesses even with the low aggregation
interval.  They made the target samples ratio on their own.  So most of other
regions looked pretty cold.

This means the logic is implemented and designed and work as expected.  But,
the resulting snapshot is not what we wanted.  We wanted the snapshot to show
practical amount of differences between regions that we can utilize for better
memory management, not the dark and cold space with a few flaming but tiny red
dots.  It might seem ok if that's the true access pattern of the workload.  And
that's true.  Some workloads would have really biased access pattern that we
cannot make useful memory management decision.  But, if that's the case,
according to our tuning theory, the logic should have maximum aggregation
interval.

I also worried about this corner case when starting the design.  I hence
considered[1] having two feedback loop goals, namely the positive access check
samples ratio and total size of >0 nr_accesses regions.  But I ended up making
this RFC with the first metric only for starting with simpler design.  I'm
still bit skeptical about having multiple goals, and looking for a better
single metric.

Now I'm thinking observed total access events ratio might make sense to be used
instead.  That is, DAMON's regions concept assumes every byte of single region
shares similar access frequency.  For example, having a DAMON region of size 4
KiB and nr_accesses 20 can be interpreted as DAMON has observed 4 * 1024 * 20
access events.  For example, below diff on top of this patch series would
explain what I'm saying about better than my text.

I will do more tests and share more findings on this thread until I post the
next spin of this patch series.

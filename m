It will be only used with the libdw, but I don't care.
"HAVE_DWARF_REG" (internal config, just indicates the arch implemented
feature) simply means there is `arch/XXX/util/dwarf-regs.c`.
Also the APIs provided by the dwarf-regs.c are still based on DWARF
standard, which defines registers by number like DW_OP_reg[0-31].
So the mapping of these suffix number and actual register must be
defined for each architecture.

That is why I had introduced dwarf-regs.c and call it "dwarf"-regs.
Even if the implementation depends on libdw, this dwarf-regs.c is
still based on DWARF standard.

Oh, wait, I think we can apply other patches. I just don't like this
patch. I think the other patches are good. But this is

Thanks! We keep a database of SFDP dumps and when we touch a flash, we
compare the SFDP dumps of the flavors of that flash ID to make informed
decisions. There are lots of flashes that have wrong SFDP data, so we
introduced some SFDP fixups, where we tweak the incorrect parameters.
Also, we encountered cases where flashes with same ID have different
SFDP data and we ended up differentiating the two based on a SFDP
difference. So we should know the SFDP even for flash updates, it help
us having a more relevant database.

With time we'll add a SFDP decoder, but we couldn't allocate time for
that yet.

A shasum on the SFDP dump would be good to have some sort of integrity
assurance, e.g.:
sha256sum /sys/bus/spi/devices/spi0.0/spi-nor/sfdp

It's possible, yes. We lean towards using only SFDP if possible. The
mechanism to determine the correct flash parameters when we have a flash
ID with 2 flavors, one with SFDP and one without, is in discussion,
we'll get to a conclusion soon. I'm willing to break backward
compatibility for non-SFDP flashes, and if/when complains arise, we'll
use the fallback mechanism to non-SFDP params. But after we'll have such
mechanism.

yes, why not. At least for people using OpenWrt.

Some test in mtd-utils would be good indeed, but narrative shall be also
ok for now. What I fear is that people just use just a flash lock/unlock
all sectors test, which is not ideal. We shall also test locking on some
sectors from the top and bottom, to verify the correctness of the TB
bit, check if BP3 is working by locking some sectors in that area.
Haven't looked at the BP area in a while, but you get my point, I feel
testing is not ideal and a guideline would help.

If you ever feel that you can spend some time on this, help is appreciated.

Thanks,

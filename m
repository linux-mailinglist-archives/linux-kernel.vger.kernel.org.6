Well, I didn't change the actual behavior and it doesn't work yet.
The deletion is just one line, and I think it reveals the intention of
the next patch very well.

It's intermediate code that is not activated yet.  So I think it's about
to say how the code works.  If you really don't like to use evsel->name,
maybe you can put a dummy name with a comment saying it'll be updated in
next patch.

Maybe others can understand a big patch easily, but I'm not.

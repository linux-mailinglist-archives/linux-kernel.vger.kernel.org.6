I am a bit confused, there are two default values here:
(1) the value returned by `try_from_param_arg(None)`.
(2) the value given by the user to the `module!` macro.

I am talking about changing the definition of ModuleParam, so (1). I get
the feeling that you are talking about (2), is that correct?

Yes definitely. I don't see anything in the code doing this currently,
right?
We could also only allow `Copy` values to be used as Parameters (but
then `str` cannot be used as a parameter...), since they can't implement
`Drop`.

Eh, why do we want to give that up? I don't think it's difficult to do.

Oh then the original code is definitely wrong, since it creates a shared
reference. Yeah then you should use `addr_of_mut!`.

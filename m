Critically, the brbe_enable() function merges the filters of all
*active* events which have been installed into hardware. It does not
track all events which can be rotated, and the resulting filter is not
the same -- it can change as a result of rotation.

No; that only works in *some* cases, and will produce incorrect results
in others.

For example, consider filtering. Imagine a PMU with a single counter,
and two events, where event-A filters for calls-and-returns and event-B
filters for calls-only. When switching from event-A to event-B, it's
theoretically possible to keep the existing records around, knowing that
the returns can be filtered out later. When switching from event-B to
event-A we cannot keep the existing records, since there are gaps
whenever a return should have been recorded.

There are a number of cases of that shape given the set of configurable
filters. In theory it's possible to retain those in some cases, but I
don't think that the complexity is justified.

Similarly, whenever kernel branches are recorded it's necessary to drop
the stale branches whenever branch recording is paused, as there's
necessarily a blackout period and hence a gap in the records.

Do you think that you have a case where losing branches across rotation
*really* matters?

I had originally wanted to keep per-event records around, but it doesn't
work in all cases. One reason events get discarded at context-switch
time is that CPU-bound events can sample branches, and would
mis-attribute stale userspace branches to the wrong context when
switching tasks. There are explicit comments about this in
amd_pmu_brs_sched_task() and intel_pmu_lbr_sched_task().

Given we discard records when reprogramming events, we *could* try to
preserve events in some cases, but I suspect that as with the rotation
case this'll be a lot of complexity for little gain. Note that as we
discard events when enabling the PMU, we'd throw some task-bound records
away anyway, and practically the gain would be limited to cpu-bound
records.

Do you have a reason why you think we *must* keep events around?

Mark.

Since DAMON has merged into the mainline, I periodically received some
questions around DAMON's mailing lists based workflow.  The workflow is
not different from the normal ones that well documented, but it is also
true that it is not always easy and familiar for everyone.

I personally overcame it by developing and using a simple tool, named
HacKerMaiL (hkml)[1].  Based on my experience, I believe it is matured
enough to be used for simple workflows like that of DAMON.  Actually
some DAMON contributors and Linux kernel developers other than myself
told me they are using the tool.

As DAMON maintainer, I also believe helping new DAMON community members
onboarding to the worklow is one of the most important parts of my
responsibilities.  For the reason, the tool is announced[2] to support
DAMON community.  To further increasing the visibility of the fact,
document the tool and the support plan on DAMON maintainer's profile.

+Mailing tool
+------------
+
+Like many other Linux kernel subsystems, DAMON uses the mailing lists
+(damon@lists.linux.dev and linux-mm@kvack.org) as the major communication
+channel.  There is a simple tool called HacKerMaiL (``hkml``) [8]_ , which is
+for people who are not very faimiliar with the mailing lists based
+communication.  The tool could particularly helpful for DAMON community members
+since it is developed and maintained by DAMON maintainer.  The tool is also
+officially announced to support DAMON and general Linux kernel developement
+workflow.
+
+In other words, ``hkml`` [8]_ is a mailing tool for DAMON community, which
+DAMON maintainer is committed to support.  Please feel free to try and report
+issues or feature requests for the tool to the maintainer.

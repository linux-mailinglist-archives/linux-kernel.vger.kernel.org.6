This makes me wonder if this message was overly wordy to begin with. 
This line is fine:

  Failure to open event 'data_read' on PMU 'uncore_imc_free_running_0'
  which will be removed.

The next bit about the syscall just repeats. The exit code could be 
included on the previous line. And the dmesg bit is general advice that 
could possibly be printed once at the end.

Is a file with only sideband events useful? Is it possible to fail the 
record command if the event doesn't open anywhere?

I noticed this leads to some different behavior and a libperf warning 
when you have paranoid=3:

   $ perf record -e cycles -C 0 -- true

   Error:
   Failure to open event 'cpu_atom/cycles/u' on PMU 'cpu_atom' which will
   be removed.
   ...
   Consider adjusting /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid setting
   ...
   libperf: Miscounted nr_mmaps 0 vs 28
   WARNING: No sample_id_all support, falling back to unordered
   processing
   [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
   [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.021 MB perf.data ]

In my basic test I saw that the opened event was identified correctly in 
perf report, unless you have an example that you encountered that we 
should fix?

One place I saw an issue was with auxtrace events. If there's an event 
name clash then you're likely to not be able to open the file afterwards 
because the auxtrace code can't handle an event that didn't open. But I 
don't know of any name clashes there (I just faked one for testing), and 
maybe that could be fixed up later in the auxtrace code if there is ever 
a real one.

Other than the above it does seem to work ok.

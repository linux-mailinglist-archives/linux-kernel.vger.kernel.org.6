Another important test would to be to make sure that IMA doesn't go into "T=
PM-
bypass" mode, which happens when the TPM initialization is for some reason
delayed.

Our emails crossed.  I suggested removing the word "encrypted" throughout t=
he
patch, as pcr_extend isn't encrypted, just HMAC'ed.

I'll re-test first thing tomorrow morning. Does the module_param require a =
value
or is specifying the name on the boot command line enough?

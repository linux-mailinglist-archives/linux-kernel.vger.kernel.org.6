Ok, thanks for clarifying.

Sounds like that would solve the issue. I was just expecting the memlat
client driver and its protocol dependency to be loaded automatically
when built as modules on machines that can use them (e.g. as we don't
want to have every vendor protocol driver built into distro kernels,
etc).

Yeah, hopefully Sibi can shed some light on this. I'm using the DT
patch (5/5) from this series, which according to the commit message is
supposed to enable bus scaling on the x1e80100 platform. So I guess
something is missing in my firmware.

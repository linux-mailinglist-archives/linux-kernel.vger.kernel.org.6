Yes correct; no need to make it bigger than section size. Thanks for the patch,
I'll certainly use it as a base when I get there or if you're interested in
doing it then even better ;-)

But I don't think this is urgent. For now, boot-time page size is a new Kconfig
for arm64. It still supports the compile-time page size options. So having a
larger MAX_PAGE_ORDER than strictly necessary doesn't represent a regression,
just a limitation of boot-time page size config - something we can optimize later.

When I say "boot-time variable" I just mean something that the arch can
configure at boot based on the selected page size. I'm not proposing to allow
the user to set it via the command line. That means we need to rid the code of
any assumptions that it is compile time constant (e.g. c preprocessor usage of
the value, etc). The same goes for MAX_PAGE_ORDER and the MMAP_RND_BITS stuff.

Hi Anshuman,

Surely because of this example we should merge? At least we have to try
to make the most common basic command lines work. Unless we expect all
tools to know whether the branch buffer is shared between PMUs on each
architecture or not. The driver knows though, so can merge the settings
because it all has to go into one BRBE.

Merging the settings in tools would be a much harder problem.

Any user that doesn't have permission for anything in the merged result
can continue to get nothing.

And we can always add filtering in the kernel later on if we want to to
make it appear to behave even more normally.

I can't see any use case where anyone would want the override behavior.
Especially if you imagine multiple users not even aware of each other.
Either the current "no records for mismatches" or the merged one make sense.

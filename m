Oh, I guess the shell is a bad example because I was unaware that there 
was a initrd option in it now. I'm buying into the boot loader/boot 
manager distinction, where the manager is largely unaware of the target 
OS's specific needs (in this case, having the initrd GUID set).

There is a separation of concerns argument here. People regularly 
complain about firmware implementations tuned for windows, but making 
the FW aware of this GUID is doing the same thing for Linux. So, IMHO 
that should be avoided, rather assuring the firmware is made as OS 
agnostic as possible, and the OS specifics are moved into the OS boot 
loader, one of which is this stub. It would make more logical sense to 
have the stub set the GUID from built in command line defaults. To be 
clear, i'm not suggesting that.

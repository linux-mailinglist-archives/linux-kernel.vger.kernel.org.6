Do we ever re-create pmd block entries back for the vmmemap range that
was split or do they remain pmd table + pte entries? If the latter, I
guess we could do a stop_machine() only for a pmd, it should be self
limiting after a while. I don't want user-space to DoS the system by
triggering stop_machine() when mapping/unmapping hugetlbfs pages.

If I did the maths right, for a 2MB hugetlb page, we have about 8
vmemmap pages (32K). Once we split a 2MB vmemap range, whatever else
needs to be touched in this range won't require a stop_machine().

What I meant is that we can leave the vmemmap alias in place and just
reuse those pages via the linear map etc. The kernel should touch those
struct pages to corrupt the data. The only problem would be if we
physically unplug those pages but I don't think that's the case here.

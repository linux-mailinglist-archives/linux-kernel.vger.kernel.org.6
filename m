This isn't different than other second chance algorithms. Those
usually set the reference bit again to buy the entry another round. In
our case, another reference causes a zswapin, which removes the entry
from the list - buying it another round. Entries will get reclaimed
once the scan rate catches up with the longest reuse distance.

The main goal, which was also the goal of the protection math, is to
slow down writebacks in proportion to new entries showing up. This
gives zswap a chance to solve memory pressure through compression. If
memory pressure persists, writeback should pick up.

If no new entries were to show up, then sure, this would be busy
work. In practice, new entries do show up at a varying rate. This all
happens in parallel to anon reclaim, after all. The key here is that
new entries will be interleaved with rotated entries, and they consume
scan work! This is what results in the proportional slowdown.

Hm.

_count() returns (objects - protected) * compression_rate, then the
shrinker does the >> priority dance. So to_scan is expected to be a
small portion of unprotected objects.

_scan() bails if to_scan > (objects - protected).

How often does this actually abort in practice?

Seek is a fixed coefficient for the scan rate.

We want to slow writeback when recent zswapouts dominate the zswap
pool (expanding or thrashing), and speed it up when recent entries
make up a small share of the pool (stagnating).

This is what the second chance accomplishes.

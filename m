paranoid=3 is a bit of a red-herring. I actually meant any paranoid 
value other than -1. The important part is "-C 0" because only root is 
allowed to open on a CPU. Or "-a" also causes the issue.

Previously you got the command failure and the hint about the paranoid 
value, but now you get the libperf error too and it still makes the file.

I still don't think a file with only sideband events is useful, I don't 
think there's even a commandline that you can run currently that results 
in that? You always need at least one event to open for it to succeed 
and I'm thinking we could keep that.

It would be nice to fix the libperf warning too because it's warning 
about something that was already warned about.

Yep, although with a caveat that I faked the second cycles PMU that 
wouldn't open, but I don't think that should make a difference:

Tested-by: James Clark <james.clark@linaro.org>

I can also test with the real thing if you like but would take a bit 
longer as I have to borrow it off Leo.

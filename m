PRR is a bit in ACTLR register which is in SMMU space,
so is the PRR_CFG_*ADDR registers - with EL1 having access
to both the registers in all targets released till now with MMU-500.
It's unlikely that this design would change in future
for MMU-500 based targets, so I feel this risk is somewhat negligible.

Also would the reserved memory route look a bit hackish?
Because, since this reserved-memory node is not used when page is
allocated through drm - so it might turn out to be redundant.
If we are aiming for a device-tree handle/node for reference then I
think a better way would be to create a bool parameter inside smmu-node 
indicating presence of PRR ?

Personally,I feel since the PRR enablement mechanism is same for all
MMU-500 targets - compat string would be a robust approach.

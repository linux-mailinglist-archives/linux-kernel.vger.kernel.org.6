IIRC, the original intention of code under if(!info->desc->ops->chan_available()
in scmi_chan_setup(), is to just handle Rx case and valid Tx missing case for
non BASE protocols. I wonder if we can add additional check at the start of
this if block:
	if (tx && prot_id == SCMI_PROTOCOL_BASE)
		return -ENODEV or -ENOENT;

just to better handle your scenario. But IIUC it may not fix your issue as
we still return success from the platform_device probing with the new
restructuring. It is only the probe of the device we create from this one
can be made to fail. I think I know understand the issue much better than
before.

Cristian mentioned in private he will explore other options just in case
we need solid alternative to address your issue.

Understood. Thanks for detailed explanation and time.

Now I know why that won't work or its not so trivial as we have some kind
of redirection to address various transport dependencies and the mechanism we
have implemented to avoid probe deferral with additional platform devices
and associated probing make it difficult to propagate the error of DD model.
We need that to handle the dependency better than relying on probe deferral
which comes with its problems(like initcall level adjustments when using
some transports like OPTEE/FFA/virtio/...). Your issue is not an issue
in normal case ðŸ˜„. Anyways, I will queue this as it is not affecting anyone
else. Hopefully no one has any objections.

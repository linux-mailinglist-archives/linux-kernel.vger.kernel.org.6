Ah sorry, wasn't being clear.

GLINK has a concept that is called "intents". An intent is an object 
that signifies that a remote channel is ready to receive a packet 
through GLINK. Intents can be pre-emptively queued, or they can be 
requested by the sending entity. GLINK will not try to send or it will 
block until there is an intent available.

Intents are exchanged with GLINK_CMD_INTENT packets. When Linux receives 
one of these packets we add it to an idr "riids".

Example sending call:
     pmic_glink_send() --> rpmsg_send() --> qcom_glink_send() --> 
__qcom_glink_send() --> qcom_glink_request_intent()

In __qcom_glink_send(), we check if there are any available intents in 
"riids", if there aren't any intents we request an intent through 
qcom_glink_request_intent(). This sends a GLINK_CMD_RX_INTENT_REQ packet 
to the remote and waits for a GLINK_CMD_RX_INTENT_REQ_ACK packet in 
return. This ack packet will have a field that says whether the intent 
has been granted or not. When linux gets this ack packet, we will wake 
up the thread waiting in qcom_glink_request_intent().

The ECANCELED comes from qcom_glink_request_intent() when we receive a 
GLINK_CMD_RX_INTENT_REQ_ACK that has granted == false.

On the firmware, when a glink channel is registered they can optionally 
fill in a handler for GLINK_CMD_RX_INTENT_REQ packets. If this handler 
is not configured, then a default one will be used where all 
GLINK_CMD_RX_INTENT_REQ packets will be responded with 
GLINK_CMD_RX_INTENT_REQ_ACK and granted == false. If a channel is 
implemented this way, then the only thing Linux can do is wait and retry 
until the remote queues the intents on its own accord.

This would be my current guess as to what's happening based on this not 
being consistent and only seen every couple of reboots. A stop path 
problem sounds like it should happen every time, and we should also see 
the remoteproc prints related to powering down the adsp. The above race 
should be applicable to all platforms but depends on the speed of the 
ADSP vs the CPU.

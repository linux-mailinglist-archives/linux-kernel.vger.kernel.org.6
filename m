So the best way to drive -Os forward is not to insist that it's good 
(it might still be crap), and not to insist that it's crap (it might 
have become better), but to dig out old problems and to look at what 
kind of code current compilers generate in the kernel with -Os.

There's been a few pathological GCC optimizations in the past, but also 
other problems, such as this one 9 years ago that hid useful warnings:

  =================>

  Date: Mon, 25 Apr 2016 17:35:27 +0200
  Subject: [PATCH] Kbuild: change CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE definition

    CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE disables the often useful -Wmaybe-unused warning,
    because that causes a ridiculous amount of false positives when combined
    with -Os. 
      
    This means a lot of warnings don't show up in testing by the developers
    that should see them with an 'allmodconfig' kernel that has
    CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE enabled, but only later in randconfig builds
    that don't.

And this one by Linus, 14 years ago:

  Subject: [PATCH] Give up on pushing CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE

    I still happen to believe that I$ miss costs are a major thing, but
    sadly, -Os doesn't seem to be the solution.  With or without it, gcc
    will miss some obvious code size improvements, and with it enabled gcc
    will sometimes make choices that aren't good even with high I$ miss
    ratios.

    For example, with -Os, gcc on x86 will turn a 20-byte constant memcpy
    into a "rep movsl".  While I sincerely hope that x86 CPU's will some day
    do a good job at that, they certainly don't do it yet, and the cost is
    higher than a L1 I$ miss would be.

    Some day I hope we can re-enable this.

I'm quite sure there were more, but these were that popped up in a 
quick Git archeology.

And yeah, it was me who pushed for -Os originally 17 years ago, due to 
the positive I$ impact, in theory:

  From: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
  Date: Mon, 28 Apr 2008 01:39:43 +0200
  Subject: [PATCH] make CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE non-experimental

    this option has been the default on a wide range of distributions
    for a long time - time to make it non-experimental.

    Signed-off-by: Ingo Molnar <mingo@elte.hu>
    Signed-off-by: Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>

But practice disagreed with theory, and obviously in the kernel 
practice has supremacy.

But yes, I'd cautiously agree that reduced kernel size with a -Os build 
is a stochastic proxy metric for better code and better performance - 
but it comes with caveats and needs to be backed by other data or 
robust first principles arguments too.

Thanks,

	Ingo

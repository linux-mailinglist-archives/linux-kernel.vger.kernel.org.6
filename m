The purpose of those eMMC nodes was to describe various non-standard 
stuff you get when discoverable devices get soldered on a board. Power 
rails, reset GPIOs, etc. It was not to put partition info there, but I 
suppose having the node opens it to such abuse.

With OpenFirmware systems, the firmware will probe PCI and populate 
nodes with what it discovered and with how it configured things. IBM 
PSeries uses DT for PCI hotplug as well, AIUI.

For Flattened DT, PCI devices are typically only present if there are 
extra non-discoverable things (again, happens when devices are soldered 
down and not in standard slots). Another example is a NIC where they 
cheaped out and didn't put an EEPROM to store the MAC address, so you 
store it in the DT. Now we're starting to see non-discoverable things 
sitting behind PCI devices, so we need the PCI device in DT to describe 
those downstream devices.

Yes, agreed.

nit: I think you mean "max_ptes_none >= HPAGE_PMD_NR/2" (greater or *equal*)?
This is making my head hurt, but I *think* I agree with you that if
max_ptes_none is less than half of the number of ptes in a pmd, then creep
doesn't happen.

To make sure I've understood;

 - to collapse to 16K, you would need >=3 out of 4 PTEs to be present
 - to collapse to 32K, you would need >=5 out of 8 PTEs to be present
 - to collapse to 64K, you would need >=9 out of 16 PTEs to be present
 - ...

So if we start with 3 present PTEs in a 16K area, we collapse to 16K and now
have 4 PTEs in a 32K area which is insufficient to collapse to 32K.

Sounds good to me!

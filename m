I would like to provide a full picture about the CSR device(to be renamed)
before get through below comments.

CSR includes some control and status registers. These registers control
several hardware block related to coresight. One example is byte counter 
function which is discussed in below mail thread. 
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAJ9a7Vjj_pcr4bZsrdqTR1=u1RHDZ_t0wgtbdn62a5j64hYrdA@mail.gmail.com/
That hardware can generate interrupt once ETR receive enough data 
so OS has chance to save it in storage. CSR is introduced here as a helper
device here since it controls the trace ID filter in ETR. 

The use case is we have two ETRs in system. We can configure one ETR as sink
for high throughput trace data  like ETM and another ETR for low throughput
trace data like STM. In this case, STM data wonâ€™t be flushed out by ETM data quickly.

The maximum number of connections for existing device is 2. But it should support
more than 2 connections and it depends on the hardware design. One more ETR device
added, four related ATID registers need add to CSR device as well.

Here is an example when enable multiple traceIDs in a stream.
Suppose we will enable three source devices with trace id 1, 2, 3 and these source devices
will enable one by one. First, we enable the source device with trace id 1. It sets bit 1
in ATID register. Then, enable the source device with trace id 2, it sets bit 2 in ATID register.
Finally, the source device with trace id 3 is enabled with set bit 3 in ATID register concurrently.
After the enablement, we have a bitmap for ATID register below:
31          0  
-------------
0.......01110

There is no way to disable filtering by CSR in this version of patch.
I will add a way to disable filtering by simply enable all bits of the register.

I just checked James's patch. I will try to re-design the function refer to James's solution.

How to obtain the trace id of the source device and pass it to CSR device is a big issue
that we must deal with. As we know the source device always be the last device to enable.
If the allocation is happened when enabling the source device, we may need a callback function
that is inserted into the enable function of the source device to help active bit in CSR device.

All source devices except for etm are allocated its trace id in probe. So, I just add function
to ensure the ETM device allocates its trace id in probe. The purpose of the modification is
to decrease the impact for current framework.

I will reconsider the way to obtain trace ID. May add a callback function is a better solution or
refer to James's solution.

I donâ€™t think our hardware have replicator trace filtering function.
Is there a new function supported by replicator?

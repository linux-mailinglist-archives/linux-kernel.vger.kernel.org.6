I added more detail in my reply to Yosry on why using ratelimited flush
for this specific case is fine.

The skipping flush for "stats_flush_ongoing" was there from the start.

No objection from me for this skipping root memcg flush idea.

Here we need more production data. I remember you mentioned MEMCG_KMEM
being used for most of the updates. Is it possible to get top 5 (or 10)
most updated stats for your production environment?

Sorry but a global mutex which can be taken by userspace applications
and is needed by node controller (to read stats) is a no from me. On a
multi-tenant systems, global locks causing priority inversion is a real
issue.

Please do expand on what you mean by dynamic time based threshold.

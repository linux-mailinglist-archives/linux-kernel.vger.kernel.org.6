(Answering as a co-author of the feature)

As prctl(PR_SET_THP_DISABLE) can only be used from the calling thread,
it needs app. developer participation anyway.
In theory, kind of a launcher-process can be used, to utilize the inheritance
of the corresponding prctl THP setting, but this seems not transparent
for the user-space.

And what if we'd like to enable THP for a specific set of unrelated (in terms of parent-child)
tasks?

IMHO, an alternative approach would be changing per-process THP-mode by PID,
thus also avoiding any user app. changes.
But that kind of thing doesn't exist yet.
Anyway, it would require maintaining a set of PIDs for a specific group of processes,
that's also some extra-work for a sysadmin.

For THP there're 3 possible levels of fine-control:
- global THP
  - THP per-group of processes
     - THP per-process

I agree, that in a container, different apps might have different
THP requirements. 
But it also depends on many factors, such as:
container "size"(tiny/huge container), diversity of apps/functions inside a container.
I mean, for some cases, we might not need to go below "per-group" level in terms of THP control.

I think the key idea for the sub-optimal behavior is "predictability",
so we know for sure which apps/services would consume THPs.
We observed a significant THP usage on almost idle Ubuntu server, with simple test running,
(some random system services consumed few hundreds Mb of THPs).
Of course, on other distros me might have different situation.
But with fine-grained per-group control it's a lot more predictable.

Am i got you question right?

Actually, i think we can solve this.
As we mostly need just a single children level,
"flat" case (root->child) is enough, interpreting root-memcg THP mode as "global THP setting",
where sub-children are forbidden to override an inherited THP-mode.

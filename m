Sorry if I was not clear, I just said I don't have confidence yet and if
the firmware is stable, then it is just the impression I have arrived based
on the discussions.

OK, is there any scope to improve in your opinion ? Please suggest and
discuss or post a patch to have separate discussion.

Interesting, it sounds like a bug. Please provide details or patch to
fix the bug. That would probably fix it on whatever platform we are
concerned here.

You seem to point at this bug several time now, we need to get it fixed,
but we need to understand it first if you want us to fix it or as mentioned
before you can as well post the patch.

Not sure what made you think we are hostile towards your contributions.
We just need a maintainable solution merged upstream and we are working
towards the same. The documents written as part of this series is not
there yet to help me understand the protocol yet. I have asked questions
and answer to those can be made part of the next version to improve it
IMO.

Honestly I am still trying to make any sense out of this vendor protocols.
The documents produced as part of this series doesn't help me understand
the same and that is my main feedback so far on this thread. I haven't
looked at the code yet so I can't comment on the same as I first need
to understand the vendor protocol document/specification.

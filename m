Currently, my idea is that all memory released by processes under memcg 
will go into the `cache`,

and the original attributes will be ignored, and can be freely requested 
by processes under memcg.

(so, dma-buf\page cache\heap\driver, so on). Maybe named PMP more 
friendly? :)

I like it too :)

Yes, I all think about it.

Let me describe it more specifically. In our test scenario, we have 8GB 
of RAM, and our camera application

has a complex set of algorithms, with a peak memory requirement of up to 
3GB.

Therefore, in a multi-application background scenario, starting the 
camera and taking photos will create a

very high memory pressure. In this scenario, any released memory will be 
quickly used by other processes (such as file pages).

So, during the process of switching from camera capture to preview, 
DMA-BUF memory will be released,

while the memory used for the preview algorithm will be simultaneously 
requested.

We need to take a lot of slow path routes to obtain enough memory for 
the preview algorithm, and it seems that the

just released DMA-BUF memory does not provide much help.

But using PMC (let's call it that for now), we are able to quickly meet 
the memory needs of the subsequent preview process

with the just released DMA-BUF memory, without having to go through the 
slow path, resulting in a significant performance improvement.

(of course, break migrate type may not good.)

I wasn't suggesting to log a kmalloc() error specifically. The idea was
that if lookup_or_create_module_kobject() fails for whatever reason,
kernel_add_sysfs_param() and version_sysfs_builtin() should log the
failure to create/get the kobject.

The error message says:
pr_crit("Adding module '%s' to sysfs failed (%d), the system may be unstable.\n", name, err);

I think it was appropriate for locate_module_kobject() to do this error
reporting when the function was only called by code in kernel/params.c
and in the boot context. Now that the patch makes the function available
to external callers, I'm not sure if it should remain reporting this
error.

The function itself shouldn't directly make the system unstable when it
fails. Each caller can appropriately determine how to handle the error.
Functions kernel_add_sysfs_param() and version_sysfs_builtin() don't
have much of an option and can only log it, but module_add_driver()
could roll back its operation.

That's it, I guess my question is really whether module_add_driver()
should do that and handle errors from lookup_or_create_module_kobject()
by propagating them up the call stack. That would be my default if
writing this code from scratch. I don't quite see why calling
lookup_or_create_module_kobject() is special in this regard.

The rest of my suggestion flows from that. Function
lookup_or_create_module_kobject() should then similarly propagate any
error upwards. However, functions kernel_add_sysfs_param() and
version_sysfs_builtin() can't really do that and so actually need to
report the error themselves.

What do you think?

I agree, just to clarify.. the reason why I mentioned using BUG_ON() in
this case was only for consistency with what's already in
kernel_add_sysfs_param(). I think it would be good to clean up other
BUG_ON() calls in that function later, but it didn't seem immediately
necessary to me as part of this series.

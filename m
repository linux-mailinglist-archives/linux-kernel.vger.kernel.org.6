Actually It's reported by smatch and Dan Carpenter also noticed this 
warning.

This is the email he sent

I'm a bit confused about fixes tag. Sometimes tool often fail to truly 
understand the context.

Form the logical perspective of the code,null deference indeed existed 
before your fixes.

But for smatch, It simply conducted a static code analysis and flagged a 
line with a warnning.

Its warning seems to be related to Commit 7ca110f2679b("tpm: Address 
!chip->auth in tpm_buf_append_hmac_session*()")

That's why I used the 'fixes' tag for Commit 7ca110f2679b.(Please 
forgive me for not being clear earlier. I discovered it through smatch.)

So, should I use the fix tag for Commit 7ca110f2679b ('tpm: Address 
!chip->auth in tpm_buf_append_hmac_session*()') or for Commit 
1085b8276bb4 ('tpm: Add the rest of the session HMAC API')?

Even though I have already send V2 which fixes tag using Commit 
1085b8276bb4 ('tpm: Add the rest of the session HMAC API'),

I still want to gain knowledge in this area so that I can more 
accurately use fxies tag and send patches in the future.

No there is no need for any dummies or thins anywhere, a codec to
codec link is simply a mechanism for hooking two codec drivers
together.

Yes you are providing a CPU side to the link, but as you say that
is actually a CODEC driver. Although I guess really this is really
more historical accident since links were originally defined between
CPUs and CODECs.

Apart from the dummy bit the diagram is fine here, it is the
description in the text that is wrong.

DAPM will power up anything that is between an active source and
an active sync. I would imagine from the diagram shown above
there would likely be two obvious use-cases:

Host music playback:
CPU -> CODEC2 -> CODEC3 -> Speaker

When something on the host plays some audio this will inform DAPM
that the main CPU DAI is now an active source. This will propogate
through the graph until it finds the speaker sink. The act of
playing music will power up the CPU -> CODEC2 dailink. Then DAPM
will power the C2C link between CODEC2 and 3 since it is on the
audio path.

Cellular call:
CODEC1 -> CODEC2 -> CODEC3 -> Speaker

In this case the host is not involved at all. The modem is audio
source and DAPM powers up everything between it and the sink ie.
the speaker. That would involve the two C2C links between CODEC1
and 2, and between CODEC2 and 3.

That I can't really be sure it depends on how your system was put
together.  There are two things that are reasonably likely:

As I said it is quite likely your system is using Dynamic PCM (DPCM)
this is a mechanism to attach multiple "Backend End" devices to a
single "Front End" DAI link. It is often used by systems that have
a DSP built into the host, which might select different places to
send the audio to. In many ways this accomplishes the same thing as
C2C links, such a system could equal well be represented with the
DSP being a codec driver and each of the "backends" being C2C links.

Alternatively, in the deep dark of history some people did implement
a "dummy link" from the host to the cellular for the purposes
of configuring the params on the modem, even though the audio
technically when through some other route. But this was always a
hack and we should probably not be detailing it in the documentation.

All the talk of front ends and back ends has nothing to do with
codec to codec links and should not be relevant for this

Have you by any chance tried to combine the usual DPCM
implementation for host side DSPs with a bunch of C2C links? It's
not necessarily wrong but it seems like an odd choice. Either
represent the DSP using DPCM or C2C links.

This doesn't seem accurate either, DAPM will only turn on things
between an active source and an active sink. So it should not be
enabling links that are not on a complete path. Although that
said the complete path might be one you didn't intent to exist
it will take any available route between a source and sink.

The more typical way to handle this would be to define a
PIN_SWITCH for the sink on each CODEC then you can enable/disable
those sinks and the CODECs in question should not get powered up
if they have no valid sinks.

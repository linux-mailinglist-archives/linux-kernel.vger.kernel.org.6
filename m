Thanks, that's not too bad then.

Protect hardware from damage by not having the powerfail during a
host-write? An active host-write command doesn't sound like the
actual cause, any writing metadata to flash more likely, which in the
deselect->poweroff case isn't ensured at all to not be the case.

While I still think this should be handled at procurement instead of the
kernel (especially if you don't even care about data integrity?), I'd
still be interested how we would ensure we aren't doing more harm than
good here.
Any info from some vendors how they implement any of these? IME only
poweroff notify would do anything at all to help and if that isn't
available we should leave the voltage up for the card and idle.

FWIW poweroff notify should probably be
EXT_CSD_POWER_OFF_SHORT
instead of the current EXT_CSD_POWER_OFF_LONG for your intended use case.

Tbh, I think OProfile's major issue was a lack of active development.
There were arguments that perf was going to be more integrated into
the kernel, but there are no arch events, for example, in
arch/arm64/events. Perf provided new energy for something started as a
student project, it was and is good for having done that.

So yes, but no. If you are used to perf on a pentium core 2 and then
move to a hybrid alderlake system there has to be some notion of what
cycles means on each core type. We had to change the tool to support
this. ARM dealt with this long before Intel hybrid ever did, but they
did so with no legacy event support just sysfs/json. Of course the
wildcard behavior means that all the PMUs that supply an event will
have it selected and people have been happy with this a long time.
We used to have BPF events but no longer. It seemed like a fruitful
thing, it became obsolete and was removed.
We have legacy encodings where LLC means L2:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools-next.git/tr=
ee/tools/perf/util/evsel.c?h=3Dperf-tools-next#n801
Fine at the time, now seems silly. LLC seems like a reasonable PMU
name, but event parsing will trip over it in the clumsy way it does
with raw events and "read" (raw event of 0xEAD). Event parsing used to
broken for events like "llc-llc" now you can have that as an event
now.

Anyway, I dislike that you are arguing that I am trying to tell people
to change their way of using the tool, it implies the patch series
breaks something. If you feel this then you should provide an example.
Yes Linus had a problem with the cycles event on Neoverse and now
that, as you suggested, is lowered to be a warning. The original patch
landed for weeks on linux-next without complaint. I am not asking
people to "re-lean the tool", I am trying to fix things and make order
out of something less than that.

So Atish spoke to us at LPC 2023:
https://lpc.events/event/17/
Mark Rutland also spoke to me at that time explaining how unhappy he
was that ARM Apple-M was broken. I combined both issues in our
discussions.
Atish has also spoken to Namhyung and myself face-to-face during the
RISC-V conference.
These issues were discussed verbally before I wrote patches, before
Atish made assumptions, and I think we both believe the proposals were
and are reasonable.

So let me completely disagree with your rephrasing. It is rude to
imply that Atish and myself somehow are trying to push an agenda of
changing and breaking an API. What has always been done is an attempt
at pragmatism, such as cleaning up the hard coded issues with the
original hybrid support, fixing Apple-M, ..

Do you want to explain this? We have events, without a PMU all events
wildcard on every PMU. This is existing and long standing behavior.
Uncore PMUs rely on it. Core PMUs with say a json event like
inst_retired.any rely on it.
You want a magic list of events that only work on core PMUs? Fine,
what is it? I hate the idea as why does cpu_cycles mean something
different than cpu-cycles, but if that is the only way to land the
series then let's do it. You had been arguing for lowering the failure
to just being a warning and not doing this. I do not understand where
you stand. My stance is hopefully clear with the patch series. If you
and Namhyung are worried that Linus seeing a warning message is a
blocker the easiest fix is to rename 1 ARM uncore event. We could hide
warnings and move them to verbose, imo that's gross. We can have a
magic list of events, similarly imo gross but at least it unblocks
this.

Thanks for making some time on this,

I agree, but seems everybody else sees it differently or does not care
enough to do anything about it.

Or is some firmware update that fixes things within reach by now?
Assuming here that the firmware is the only problem here (not sure at
all if that is the case), as users never should be expected to update
the firmware to fix a regression caused by a kernel change.

Hmmm. Given the above I wonder if it would be good if you could make the
reporter test a kernel with the revert and see if that helps -- and if
it does then consider submitting that (with Linus and the -net
maintainers in CC) to see if that gets anybody into action.

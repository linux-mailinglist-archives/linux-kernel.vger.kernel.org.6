Currently when DAMON_MIN_REGION is defined as PAGE_SIZE, and both vm start
and end are commonly page-aligned, then the [0x, 0x1100) could not be created,
but I'm not sure either.

damon_va_evenly_split_region() is called in __damon_va_init_regions(), and nr_pieces
is calculated by:

   `nr_pieces = (regions[i].end - regions[i].start) / sz;`

Above regions[i].start/regions[i].end/sz is determine at runtime, and sz can beaffected
by minimum number of regions, user can change that, am I right? Then nr_pieces can be 1 !
On the other hand, I think damon_va_evenly_split_region() itself should handle
the 'nr_pieces == 1' case, or if we make sure that case is unreal, would it be better to
add some assertion?

I think this case exists, as above reply.

As an unit test, damon_va_evenly_split_region() itself should be able
to handle the 'nr_pieces == 1' case, right? I think this testcase can
be added in case something goes wrong one day.

Well, yes, I'll do it in v2 after all the discussions for this version are complete!

Yes, this is for 'nr_pieces == 1' case, and if we have above `if (nr_pieces == 1) return 0;` line,
then this is not needed since nr_pieces > 1, and following loop will at least two times

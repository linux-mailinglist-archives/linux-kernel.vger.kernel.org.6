I did add Guenter to the thread, but really, I cannot offer more
testing than the configs we use in production. I don't use GCC as we
mostly use clang, and we don't use early LSMs which is such a special
case with two extra configs with lockdown. Calling it having a
"history of not being tested is unfair".

If there is a general process / tests you follow before merging
patches, I am happy to run them. In the absence of that, it's not easy
to spot corner cases.

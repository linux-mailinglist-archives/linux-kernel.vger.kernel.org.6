I apologize for my delayed response.

Perhaps a safer approach could be to introduce a new dtsi file, named
sun50i-a64-cpu-opps-disabled.dtsi, with the following contents:

/delete-node/ &cpu0_opp_table;

&cpu0 {
	/delete-property/ operating-points-v2;
};

&cpu1 {
	/delete-property/ operating-points-v2;
};

&cpu2 {
	/delete-property/ operating-points-v2;
};

&cpu3 {
	/delete-property/ operating-points-v2;
};

The purpose of this new file would be to delete the CPU OPPs for the
suboptimally designed boards, when included into their dts(i) files,
while the CPU OPPs would be "encapsulated" into the SoC dtsi.

Though, I'm not sure how much cleaner this approach would be, but
I think it would fit rather well with the suggested approach of having
such suboptimal board designs treated as an exception that would be
handled in some special way.  As a bonus, it would also make locating
dts(i) files for such suboptimal designs a bit simpler, by grepping
for "cpu-opps-disabled".

It may be THE TRUTH, but this is not what userspace expects.
A user calls e.g. /usr/bin/wget and they really expect 'pgrep wget'
to return a PID. They don't care that the dentry name is actually
'wget2', even if the exec is realized through fexecve.

Kees explained this really well, please check his mail. Everybody
knows that argv[0] is (or rather can be) different.

What people expect is for /proc//comm to be the basename of the path
that was passed to execve(2). Give me an interface that allows the
caller to use fexecve() instead and set comm. I don't really care how
that interface looks, as long as it's possible to set comm to
mimick previous behaviour.

The patch uses argv[0] because in a great majority of cases in normal
use basename(argv[0]) is the same as comm. So it provides a good
fallback. _Better_ than the dentry name, as far as the userspace is
concerned.

That's not what I said. What was said is that argv[0] can be used
to set comm in a way that _the userspace expects_.

To be clear: the dentry name goes 95% of the way. It certainly
is better than the current "3" or whatever. If we cannot fix the
remaining 5%, we'll need to adjust some userspace and possibly
have some annoyed users. So I'd prefer that the kernel merges a
patch that uses the dentry name, but it'd be better to use
argv[0] which solves the problem 99+% of the way.

Yes, this is exactly what Kees wrote in his mail. Nobody is disputing
that.

I have a generic execution engine (systemd). Userspace uses it to call
arbitrary programs. That userspace expects that comm/pgrep/top/htop/etc/etc/etc
show the "name of the program". The _name by which it was called_.
For decades, this has been the symlink name, not target.

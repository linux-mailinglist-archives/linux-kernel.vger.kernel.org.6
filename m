Maybe just dma (I think the term isn't used heavily anymore, so the word is
kinda open)? But, hopefully, others have better ideas.

That's great to hear.

Yeah, I get that this is about memory and that is about processing capacity,
so the plan is going for separate controllers for each? Or would it be
better to present both under the same controller interface? Even if they're
going to be separate controllers, we at least want to be aligned on how
devices and their configurations are presented in the two controllers.

Thanks.

I don't think this is about allocation failure? It's about finding a folio order
that fits into the VMA without overlapping any already non-none PTEs.

My proposal was to deliberately fault in a single (4K) page every 128K. That
will cause the scanning logic to reduce the order to the next lowest enabled
order and try again. So with the current code, for all orders {1M, 512K, 256K,
128K} you would scan the first 128K of ptes (32 entries) then for 64K you would
scan 16 entries = 4 * 32 + 16 = 144 entries. For the new change, you would just
scan 32 entries.

Although now that I've actually written that down, it doesn't feel like a very
big win. Perhaps Dev can come up with an even more contrived single-page
pre-allocation pattern that will maximise the number of PTEs we hit with the
current code, and minimise it with the new code :)

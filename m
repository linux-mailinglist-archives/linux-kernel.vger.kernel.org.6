I'm juggling too many things around. I was thinking that 27152bceea1d
was b63db58e2fa5d. My mistake.

OK, I see what your saying. So the bug is present with 27152bceea1d,
but so are a lot of other bugs. This was completely rewritten with the help
from Linus, and an effort was made to backport it all to 6.6.

The above includes the 5790b1fb3d672 commit. Which is why this is the
commit I labeled as the main patch to backport to.

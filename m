Hey Rob, In suspend/resume, the register space power rails are not in
disabled state, so it won't go back to reset values and should retain
it's value. Only in hibernation cycle the registers' value would get reset.

So the hi/low address bit register for PRR page would also retain it's 
value along with the ACTLR registers.

Sounds okay though since this would not interact with suspend/resume path.
But I think, suppose in-case this page would have some other references 
as well before configuring the address to the registers for PRR 
configuration, then  GPU would be dependent on arm-smmu-qcom for this page.
So Instead an endpoint api in arm-smmu-qcom.c can recieve the just the 
page-address, and bit set status from drm/msm driver and can set/reset 
the bit along with any page-address they want ?
It would mean the interface will be smmu's , but the choice of 
configuration data to the registers' will be still with gpu.

I wrote up a small patch with this implementation, would you like to 
review that?
Will send it in this v11 series as new patch.

Thanks & regards,
Bibek

Yes, e2scrub is very nice, but it has too many limitations. We have some
customers who don't use lvm.

Indeed, our rough plan is to first implement isolation of abnormal file
system resources, so that the system can continue to run normally even
when there is an error; then implement online scanning, so that the
maintainer can see the health report at any time; and finally implement
the most difficult online repair.

We do need to establish the mapping of physical blocks to inodes and inodes
to parent dir. By tree managed by jbd2 do you mean updating the tree when
committing to journal? Or are updates to the tree logged to journal?

Yeah, reflink is pretty cool, we can try it out when the others are done.

Thank you for your suggestion! This is really key to the development. We'll
discuss the overall design internally before consulting the community.

The XFS maintainability enhancement is something my colleague is working
on. But we have a fair number of downstream customers who prefer ext4, so
it's worth investing the time to do that.

Of course! we will keep the code as simple and maintainable as possible.

Thanks again for your input! 😉

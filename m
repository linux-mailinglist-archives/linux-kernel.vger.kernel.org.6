Ah, that is the detail I was missing, now I see what you are trying to 
achieve, thanks!

It is a bit architecture specific, because ... imagine architectures 
that have separate kernel+user space page table hierarchies, and not a 
simple PTE flag to change access permissions between kernel/user space.

IIRC s390 is one such architecture that uses separate page tables for 
the user-space + kernel-space portions.

Okay, so in this RFC you are jumping through quite some hoops to have a 
kernel allocation unmapped from the direct map but mapped into a 
per-process page table only accessible by kernel space. :)

So you really don't want this mapped into user space at all 
(consequently, no GUP, no access, no copy_from_user ...). In this RFC 
it's mapped but turned inaccessible by flipping the "kernel vs. user" 
switch.

That sounds like a better approach. So we would remove the pages from 
the shared kernel direct map and map them into a separate kernel-portion 
in the per-MM page tables?

Can you envision that would also work with architectures like s390x? I 
assume we would not only need the per-MM user space page table 
hierarchy, but also a per-MM kernel space page table hierarchy, into 
which we also map the common/shared-among-all-processes kernel space 
page tables (e.g., directmap).

Yes, but memfd_secret() was really design for user space to hold 
secrets. But I can see how you came to this solution.

Naive question: does arm64 rather resemble the s390x model or the x86-64 
model?

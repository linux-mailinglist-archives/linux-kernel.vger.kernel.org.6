Ah - I think I wanted to mention this specific bit in my email and forgot b=

yeah: it is kind of impossible for us to recreate a KmsDriver/Driver.

FWIW: any kind of transmute like that where there isn't a compiler-provided
guarantee that it's safe is usually considered unsafe in rust land (especia=
lly
when it's coming from a pointer we haven't verified as valid).

This being said though - and especially since AsRaw* are all sealed traits
anyways (e.g. they're not intended to be implemented by users, only by the
rust DRM crate) there's not really anything stopping us from splitting the
trait further and maybe having three different classifications of object:=
=C2=A0

Fully typed: both Driver implementation and object implementation defined
Opaque: only Driver implementation is defined
Foreign: neither implementation is defined

Granted though - this is all starting to sound like a lot of work around ru=
st
features we would otherwise strongly want in a DRM API, so I'm not sure how=
 I
feel about this anymore. And I'd definitely like to see bindings in rust
prioritize rust first, because I have to assume most partially converted
drivers are going to eventually be fully converted anyway - and it would ki=
nda
not be great to prioritize a temporary situation at the cost of ergonomics =
for
a set of bindings we're probably going to have for quite a while.

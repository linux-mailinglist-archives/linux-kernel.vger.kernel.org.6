Please correct me if I am wrong, IIUC you have applcations with
different latency or performance requirements, running on the same
system but the system is memory constraint. You want applications with
stringent performance requirement to go less in the allocation slowpath
and want the lower priority (or no perf requirement) applications to do
more slowpath work (reclaim/compaction) for themselves as well as for
the high priority applications.

What about the allocations from the softirqs or non-memcg-aware kernel
allocations? 

An alternative approach would be something similar to the watermark
based approach. Low priority applications (or kswapds) doing
reclaim/compaction at a higher newly defined watermark and the higher
priority applications are protected through the usual memcg protection.

I can see another use-case for whatever the solution we comeup with and
that is userspace reliable oom-killer.

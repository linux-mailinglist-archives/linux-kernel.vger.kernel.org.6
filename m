Many allocators differentiate object lifecycles to minimize
fragmentation. While this isn't a new concept, you argue it's irrelevant
without a clearcut use case.

The use case I had in mind was build output directories (e.g., Android).
These consume object files in zram until the next build.

Other potential scenarios involve separate zrams: one for foreground
apps (short-term) and another for cached apps (long-term). Even
zswap and zram could have different object lifecycles, as zswap might
write back more aggressively.

While you see no clear use cases, I disagree with dismissing this
concept without strong justification.

How about introducing a flag like "bool slab_merge" in zs_create_pool?
This would allow zswap to unify slabs while others don't.

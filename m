Yes, the Qualcomm-specific aspect is that it's Qualcomm's hypervisor 
which is broken and reporting a larger number in its emulated 
SMMU_IDR1.NUMCB than the number of context banks it's actually willing 
to emulate.

I guess if we *were* to consider a generic property to endorse violating 
the SMMU architecture, then it would logically be vendored to Arm as the 
owner of the SMMU architecture. However I am strongly against that idea, 
not only because I obviously don't want to normalise hypervisors 
emulating non-architectural behaviour which every DT-consuming OS will 
have to understand how to work around, but it's also less than great for 
the user to have a workaround that's not compatible with existing DTBs.

Luckily, in this case it seems straightforward enough to be able to see 
that if we have a "qcom,msm8996-smmu-v2" with 13 context banks then we 
should just treat it as if it has 12 - it's also notable that it only 
reports NUMSMRG=12, so we couldn't use more than that many S1 context 
banks at once anyway.

Thanks,
Robin.

Exactly, that's what I pointed out as well to the previous reply to Dan:
it's matter of our care about number of things.

I hardly can imagine how _nowadays_ this may be still useful in this form.
What I admit is the lore archive and Link tag is really useful. Much more
than bare Cc list.

Maybe at some point in time. As you know he is the most conservative maintainer
(from tooling or workflow perspective), so it might take time, but I'm going to
do my best to convince people to look at this problem from different angles.

The Link tag will refer to the one that has been applied. It keeps not less
information as bare Cc list, but on top one may:

1) either put a few Link tags with versioning;
2) or refer to the previous version of the patches in the respective cover
letter.

I see some people / scripts? still put mailing lists to the Cc list which
comes as part of the commit messages. This is most odd part to me why.

I will try, definitely.

Hi Doug and Daniel,

In the current state using KDB in keyboard mode doesn't react to expected
CTRL chords such as CTRL+N/P/A/E, but does react to arrow keys,
Following this, I have also inspected the serial mode and over there I see
that both arrows and CTRL chords work.
From what I understand going forward, the best solution would be to add support
for the CTRL chords in the keyboard mode as well to be in line with serial?

BTW I originally wanted to add support also for CTRL+U and CTRL+W what is your
opinion about that as a feature as well?

Thanks,
Nir

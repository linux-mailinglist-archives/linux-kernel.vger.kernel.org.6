Ack, Just posted the latest version v15 for this series , based on the 
compatible string based design approach [1] as discussed.

While completion of patch, I came to know that it might sometimes
be possible on Qualcomm SoC's, same IP/device on 2 different SoC
can have different ACTLR settings as well.
[1] _can take care of that case_ as well through different compatible
strings but this can be handled through per-SoC solution as well.

In the latest patch [1], I am going forward with Robin's suggestion
of single table per smmu, and can later follow up there if any
conflict happens.

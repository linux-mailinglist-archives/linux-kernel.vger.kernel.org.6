Yes, I understand the current situation. I just feel blk-throttle have
no such capacity to limit IOs that are issuing from user. There could
also be filesystems, and data blocks can be fragmented.

It's not just fundamentally flawed, and the implementation is just too
one-sided. So what is the next step?

- remove iops limit since it's not that useful;
- swith iops limit to against disk;
- do nothing?

Most of our users will just set meaningful bps limit, however, since
iops limit is supported they will set it as well, without much knowledge
how it really works, causing some unexpected phenomenon. And for now,
we'll suggest not to set iops limit, no even a high limit.

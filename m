I think this is interesting. I'm a little concerned on the approach as
I wonder if a more flexible mechanism could be had.

One approach that wouldn't work would be to open high and low
frequency events, or groups of events, then use BPF filters to try to
replicate this approach by dropping most of the high frequency events.
I don't think it would work as the high frequency sampling is likely
going to trigger during the BPF filter execution, and the BPF filter
would be too much overhead.

Perhaps another approach is to change the perf event period with a new
BPF helper function that's called where we do the perf event
filtering. There's the overhead of running the BPF code, but the BPF
code could allow you to instead of alternating between two periods
allow you to alternate between an arbitrary number of them.

Thanks,
Ian

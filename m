I think, this is where we disagree/talk-past-each-other.  Looking at the
code, I do believe the the situation *also* occurs without any lock
yielding involved.  Yes, the situation if far-worse when we have lock
yielding, but it also happens in the default case.

With current patch proposal [V8 or V9].
Assuming we have no lock yielding.

Do we agree that 12 kswapd threads will be waiting on the lock, when a
level>0 were ongoing flusher when they were started?
Then level>0 finishes being ongoing flushed.
Then kswapd0 gets lock, observe NULL as ongoing, and becomes ongoing.
Then kswapd1 gets lock, observe NULL as ongoing, and becomes ongoing.
Then kswapd2 gets lock, observe NULL as ongoing, and becomes ongoing.
Then kswapd3 gets lock, observe NULL as ongoing, and becomes ongoing.
Then kswapd4 gets lock, observe NULL as ongoing, and becomes ongoing.
Then kswapd5 gets lock, observe NULL as ongoing, and becomes ongoing.
Then kswapd6 gets lock, observe NULL as ongoing, and becomes ongoing.
[etc]

Please, let me know if I misunderstood my own code, and you believe this
scenario cannot happen.

When above happens, then patch didn't solve the kswapd thundering herd
issue that we observe in production.

The point/problem is that once kswapd is waiting on the lock, then code
doesn't re-check the ongoing flusher, and every kswapd thread will be
spinning and every kswapd thread will need to go through the flush.
When a kswapd thread gets the lock, then it will observe ongoing as
NULL, so it cannot detect that another level=0 just were the ongoing.

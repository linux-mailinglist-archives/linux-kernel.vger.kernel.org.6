But then with -fpie, unreachable instructions would always be ignored,
which is not ideal as those warnings are actually very useful and often
point to bigger problems.

For x86 I believe -fjump-tables is still a possibility in some configs,
so it still needs to work.  That said we may be behind on keeping up
with all the latest warnings.  Jump table detection has always been
whack-a-mole hacks.

And we'd want to support it for other arches as well.

I spoke with several people about this at GNU Cauldron last month and
there is definitely interest in helping out.  If you and Kees also want
to help out, that would be awesome.

Jan proposed an idea to apply a R_*_NONE relocation at the indirect
branch instruction which references the jump table address.  And then
emit a sized ELF symbol for each jump table entry.  That would be all we
need.

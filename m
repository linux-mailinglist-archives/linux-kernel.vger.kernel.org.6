Yep; I'm referring to the vmalloc space being lazily faulted-in and
copied from init_mm into the active pgd under do_translation_fault().

Looking some more, I don't see how VMAP_STACK guarantees that the
old/active stack is mapped in the new mm when switching from the old mm
to the new mm (which happens before __switch_to()).

Either I'm missing something, or we have a latent bug. Maybe we have
some explicit copying/prefaulting elsewhere I'm missing?

What happens when switching between two tasks whose stacks happen to be
in distinct sub-trees of the vmalloc tables?

Yep -- the problem is when we can safely do that syncing up, since the
lazy syncing in do_translation_fault() can't safely be used to sync
anything that's used during do_translation_fault(), including the stack,
etc.

Mark.

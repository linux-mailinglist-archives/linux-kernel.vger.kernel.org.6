I mostly agree on what you have wrote. But I see a big problem in
running the EFI emulator in user space when it comes to secure boot.
The chain of trust ends in the kernel. So it's the kernel that needs to
verify that the image to be loaded can be trusted. But when the EFI
runtime is in user space the kernel simply cannot do that. Which means,
if we want to go this way, we would need to extend the chain of trust
to user space. Which will be a whole bucket of worms, not just a can.

That's why I tend more to Jan's suggestion to include the EFI runtime
in the kernel. Alas, that comes with it's own problem, as that requires
to run code in the kernel that was never intended to run in kernel
context. So even when we can trust the code not to be malicious, we
cannot trust it to not accidentally change the system state in a way
the kernel doesn't expect...

Let me throw an other wild idea in the ring. Instead of implementing
a EFI runtime we could also include a eBPF version of the stub into the
images. kexec could then extract the eBPF program and let it run just
like any other eBPF program with all the pros (and cons) that come with
it. That won't be as generic as the EFI runtime, e.g. you couldn't
simply kexec any OS installer. On the other hand it would make it
easier to port UKIs et al. to non-EFI systems. What do you think?

Thanks
Philipp

I do think you missed something. Let me try to explain this in another 
way. (I hope my frustrations doesn't shine through).

The main purpose of the patch is/was to stop the thundering herd of 
kswapd thread flushing (root-cgrp) at exactly the same time, leading to 
lock contention. This happens all-the-time/constantly in production.

The first versions (where ongoing was limited to root/level=0) solved 
this 100%.  The patches that generalized this to be all levels can 
become ongoing flush, doesn't solve the problem any-longer!

I hope it is clear what fails. E.g. When a level>0 becomes ongoing 
flusher, and 12 kswapd simultaneously does a level=0/root-cgrp flush, 
then we have 12 CPU cores spinning on the rstat lock. (These 12 kswapd 
threads will all go-through completing the flush, as they do not 
discover/recheck that ongoing flush was previously became their own level).

I think we need to go back to only having root-cgroup as ongoing flusher.

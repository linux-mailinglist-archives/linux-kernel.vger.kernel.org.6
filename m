It is setup by the Dynamic Launch Preamble (GRUB) that will invoke the 
Dynamic Launch Event (GETSEC[SENTER]).

I think there might be some confusion on how this starts, let me provide 
a quick, enumerated flow:

1. GRUB prepares launch environment (Linux kernel, SINIT ACM, 
OsSinitData) and calls GETSEC[SENTER] instruction
2. The CPU signals PCH that DRTM has started, unlocking Locality 4
3. The CPU loads the SINIT ACM into CRAM, measures it with SHA256 and 
uses _TPM_HASH_START /_TPM_HASH_DATA / _TPM_HASH / _TPM_HASH_END to 
extend SHA256(ACM) | EDX into PCR17 for all PCR banks
4. The CPU then jumps into the ACM
5. The ACM does a series of actions and measurements of the system into 
PCRs 17 and 18 for SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, and SM3_256 (PCR Performance 
Policy)
6. The ACM then measures the "MLE", the Linux kernel in this case, using 
the same algorithms
7. The ACM then caps PCRs 17 and 18 by extending 0x01 for any 
unsupported algorithm the TPM supports.
8. The ACM then jumps to the Secure Launch entry point in the setup kernel

If the initramfs is external, then yes, the setup kernel would get to do 
the measurement. If it is a unified kernel image, well, that whole thing 
will be bit banged to the TPM by the ACM if the PCR Agile Policy is used.

Correct, capping the PCR should never block downstream software from 
consuming the event log.

There are two scenarios that could be considered here. The first is if 
an algorithm is added to the TPM that neither the ACM nor the TPM driver 
supports. The second is if an algorithm supported by the ACM and the TPM 
driver is added, but not supported by Secure Launch.

In the first case, the PCR and corresponding log entries for the new 
algorithm will have the D-CRTM event and Cap (0x01) event. Rendering the 
bank unusable for the attacker.

For the second case, this is a "it all depends on the usage". First and 
foremost, I would say it is ultimately a failure of the Attestation 
Service if it evaluated algorithms that Secure Launch is not advertised 
to support.

With that, let's consider the options for bad components under the 
second case:
- A bad kernel image will be detected since the ACM is what measures it.
- A bad initramfs, assuming that (c) below was not implemented, then the 
initramfs could add a fake entry for itself into the bank in question.
- Any component after this depends on the use case. The primary use case 
currently is to combine Secure Launch with TrenchBoot additions to 
u-root making it an intermediate bootloader that kexec's into the target 
kernel. I bring this up because when the kexec is done, Secure Launch 
does GETSEC[SEXIT]. The result being that it closes all localities 
except Locality 0. They cannot be re-opened without doing a new Dynamic 
Launch, which will reset them all back to 0.

I would also like to note that Secure Launch would not be the only 
in-kernel capability that would have to scramble to add support for the 
additional algorithm if it suddenly became available to block a Carte 
Blanche attack.

With (c) in place, it would completely close off the second case for the 
case when the initramfs is not part of the kernel image.

Do you mean TPM2_HashSequenceStart / TPM2_SequenceUpdate / 
TPM2_EventSequenceComplete? If you really meant _TPM_Hash_Start / 
_TPM_Hash_Data / _TPM_Hash_End, then no, you cannot call these. They are 
not sent via the Command Buffer but directly through the TPM interface. 
Have a look at Section 34 of the TPM Architecture[1]. While the spec 
authors wrote it generically, as if there is more than one way for an 
H-CRTM to be established, the only way available for x86 is DRTM.

[1] 
https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TPM-2.0-1.83-Part-1-Architecture.pdf

Ross has prepared a new version of the series using (c), which actually 
reduces the size and complexity of the SL setup code. Once it has been 
tested, Ross will post it so you can have some concrete code to look at 
and consider the proposal.

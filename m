It shouldn't be though, it's just reading a sequence number - I'd much
prefer if it could be at least a static inline.

Which you won't want to do, because it would mean exposing RCU private
data structures; hence my approach of exposing an RCU-only api for
getting a pointer to the sequence number.

Ok, good to know

We don't want to falsely think the object expires later than it actually
does, and have more accumulated work than we need to.

I would have much preferred if your existing code worked with SRCU. You
think I'm doing this for fun?

We would of course want benchmarks to show that this was worthwhile
before switching call_rcu(), since absent a performance improvement we'd
want to stick with the approach that doesn't allocate memory.

Because?

I agree, and having this on by default also helps non-ABMC-aware users.

Yes, that's reasonable.  It could be a good idea to document this
behaviour of switching the mbm_cntr_assign mode, if we think it is
useful and people are likely to rely on it.

Since mkdir is an implementation detail of the resctrl interface, I'd
be tempted to go for a more generic name, say,
"mbm_assign_new_mon_groups".  But that's just bikeshedding.
The proposed behaviour seems fine.

Either way, if this is not included in this series, it could be added
later without breaking anything.

I don't have a strong view either.

I don't have a concrete use case here -- I was just trying to imagine
the experience of an ABMC-aware user who wants full control over what
counters get assigned.

I agree that the convenience of the non-ABMC-aware user should probably
take priority over that of the ABMC-aware user, at least in situations
where the expected behaviour is achievable (i.e., where we didn't run
out of counters to auto-assign.)

Cheers

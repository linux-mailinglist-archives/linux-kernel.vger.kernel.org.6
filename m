Thanks! Yes its unfortunate timing - there are a few topics I would have liked
to get involved with. There's always next year...

Yes possibly. One potential future new user of this common code would be arm32
(arch/arm), which also has the contig bit. But AIUI, the pmd an pte formats are
quite different. It's likely that arm would want to opt-in to contpte but not
huge_ptep, so separate selectors may be valuable.

Thanks! If it's too difficult then it's not a deal-breaker. Perhaps just an
initial patch to move the existing arm functions to core-mm without change, then
all your existing patches on top of that would do the job?

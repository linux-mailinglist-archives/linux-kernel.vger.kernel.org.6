Hi Stephen,

I only discover this thread today, interesting read!

Not only ChromeOS devices are affected, there have been several reports
with similar issues on the mailing list, especially on i.MX8MP, where
the clock and power management domains are tightly connected.

I am happy we ended-up leaning to the same solution: runtime PM calls
should no longer happen after acquiring the prepare lock.

I fear splitting the locks will actually not solve the problems we
encounter on i.MX8.

Let me quote some parts of your commit log in patch 4/5:

--->8---

Regarding your former statement, I don't think it is impossible, this
is what I've been trying to do recently. It is really impacting, and
must be handled specifically for each situation: I am counting three of
them depending on the action, where either the parents, or the
children or both sides of the tree should be resumed before
continuing (with optionally the new parent, when reparenting explicitly
or doing some rate changes which also involve reparenting). I don't yet
have a working proof-of-concept -I would have loved to before LPC- but
this is promising and I believe doable.

About your second paragraph however, I am asking whether being "most of
the time" incrementing or decrementing the runtime PM count is
acceptable, because if we ever perform a real state change within the
right conditions, we will just deadlock the platform. This is
theoretical and is unlikely to happen in general, I agree. But shall we
consider this situation too unlikely from happening for just ignoring
it? Shall we instead fix it properly and prepare ourselves for future
power-optimized architecture with a lot of dependencies between clocks
and other power-related subsystems? This is an open question.

Is there any public branch I could look into?

On my side I tried to warn about this but got no feedback. I'd have
loved to be pointed towards this patchset at that time :) Here is the
report if you want to check it out. FYI, I was asking for feedback on
very specific questions, which I consider now solved:

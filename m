I did as much clarification as I possibly can.

Also, if you look at confidential computing platforms there's exactly
two assets that they use lock into machine:

- Binary
- CPU material

Only carved into stone immutable material for key derivation.

You can use mm_struct->exe_file binary if that will work out for you.
I'm done with this version.

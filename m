I'm a bit confused here.  It's TPM2_PCR_Extend we have the trouble with
(as Mimi says in her email that you quoted) not TPM2_GetRandom.

The random number generator reseed occurs in a kernel thread that fires
about once a minute, so it doesn't show up in really any of the boot
timings.  Plus even with sessions added, what there now isn't a
significant overhead even to the running kernel given it's asynchronous
and called infrequently.

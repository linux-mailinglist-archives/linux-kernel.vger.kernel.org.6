Hi dimitry & mani,

This particular board variant doesn't expose any open slots to connect
a different endpoints like another switch(which might have BDF unknown
to us) so static table should be fine for this board variant.

I tries to add iommu-map-mask property, the issue with that property is
that the driver is applying the mask to the bdf before searching for the
entry in the table. If I use a mask value which satisfies all the
entries in the table ( mask as 0x718) and if a new bdf is enumerated
lets say 0x600 due to mask 0x718 its value is again 0x600 only.

Can we skip iommu-map-mask property and use only static table for this
board as we know this board doesn't expose any open slots.

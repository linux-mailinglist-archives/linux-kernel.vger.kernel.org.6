Isn't it kind of a philosophical question whether a delay added by the SoC
integration is part of the MAC or not? One could also argue that the MAC IP=
 core
is always the same, with some SoCs adding the delay and others not. (I don'=
t
know if there are actually SoCs with the same IP core that don't add a dela=
y;
I'm just not a big fan of hiding details in the driver that could easily be
described by the Device Tree, thus making the driver more generic)

Hmm okay, this is what the similar ICSSG/PRUETH driver does. I've always fo=
und
that solution to be particularly confusing, but if that's how it's supposed=
 to
work, I'll have to accept that.

In my opinion the documentation Documentation/networking/phy.rst is not ver=
y
clear on this matter - the whole section "(RG)MII/electrical interface
considerations" talks about whether the PHY inserts the delay or not, so my
assumption was that phy-mode describes the PHY side of things and only that=
.

It gets even more confusing when taking into account
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/ethernet-controller.yaml, which conta=
ins
comments like "RGMII with internal RX delay provided by the PHY, the MAC sh=
ould
not add an RX delay in this case", which sounds like there are only the cas=
es
"delay is added by the PHY" and "delay is added by the MAC" - the case "del=
ay is
part of the board design, neither MAC nor PHY add it" doesn't even appear.

I can make this change, but "am65-cpsw-nuss" currently supports 6 different
compatible strings, many of which are used for multiple SoC families.

Maybe someone from TI could chime in and say whether all of these have the =
fixed
TXC delay, or at least the current compatible strings are already specific
enough to tell whether the SoC adds a delay?

Makes sense, I'll write a patch for that as well.

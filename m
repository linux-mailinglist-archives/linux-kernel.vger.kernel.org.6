Yes, it boggles the mind. And for a language that doesn't care about
size, it sure cares about size in weird places.

I'm not sure -- I have kind of given up on "standard" C helping with any
of this. I look to consistent language extensions now, and where there
isn't any, we've been trying to create them. :P And we're not alone:
Apple's -fbounds-safety stuff[1] looks good too, and overlaps with what
we were already designing with the "counted_by" attribute:
https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-enforcing-bounds-safety-in-c-fbounds-safety/
(We borrowed the "counted_by" name, which is better than what we were
calling it: "element_count".)

This. A thousands times, this. I'm really not okay with it, and we've
been working to get rid of every ambiguity we trip over. It's made sane
bounds checking in Linux extremely hard to get right.

For more fun with array bounds, the one that absolutely floored me was
the exception over trailing arrays:

struct middle_t {
	u8 array[6];
	int foo;
} *middle;

__builtin_object_size(middle->array, 1)  ==  6

struct trailing_t {
	int foo;
	u8 array[6];
} *trailing;

__builtin_object_size(trailing->array, 1)  ==  SIZE_MAX ("unknown")

Because of all the fake flexible array abuses over decades, _bos/_bdos
were forced to _ignore_ the size of an array if it was the last member
of a struct. But after C99 flexible arrays were introduced (24 years
ago), nobody cleaned this up! We had to go get the compilers to create
-fstrict-flex-arrays=3 so that all those weird behaviors would go away:

Right -- the way to make this unambiguous has been to make sure there
is an addressable object which contains the elements in question. For
the least disruption, the best we were able to do is introduce the
struct_group() helper. It's internally ugly, but it works.

A way to do this would be:

struct pt_regs {
	union {
		struct {
			unsigned long bx;
			unsigned long cx;
			unsigned long dx;
			unsigned long si;
			unsigned long di;
			unsigned long bp;
		};
		unsigned long syscall_regs[6];
	};
	unsigned long ax;
	...
};

Now regs->syscall_regs is addressable, sized, etc. "bx" means just bx,
and "syscall_regs" means all 6.

I wrote up a bunch of notes about much of this horror last year here:

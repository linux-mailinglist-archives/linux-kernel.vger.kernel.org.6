Seems like a separate issue.  Since the session is created
by __perf_session__new(), session->tool will always be a pointer
to a const tool once there is:

diff --git a/tools/perf/util/session.h b/tools/perf/util/session.h

It still can be changed by the caller of __perf_session__new(), since
the tool itself is not const.

Anything using container_of() like:

static int process_sample_event(const struct perf_tool *tool,
				union perf_event *event,
				struct perf_sample *sample,
				struct evsel *evsel,
				struct machine *machine)
{
	struct perf_script *scr = container_of(tool, struct perf_script, tool);

can then change scr->tool without even having to cast away const.

Really, 'tool' needs to be defined as const in the first place.

It creates another question though: since there is a lot of code
before perf_tool__init() is called, does the caller mistakenly
change tool before calling perf_tool__init()

The caller does not need the "defaults", so why would it set them up.
The session could just as easily do:

	if (tool->cb)
		tool->cb(...);
	else
		cb_stub(...);

perf_tool__init() is not a steeping stone to making 'tool' a
const in the first place.

How is this not a security hole you could drive a truck through?
Indeed, looking at the docs, TPM2_PCR_Extend says "If no digest value
is specified for a bank, then the PCR in that bank is not modified."

At least extending unknown/unsupported banks with 0 modifies the bank,
which gives software that might rely on that bank an indication that
something in the chain doesn't support the bank.  But does actual
TPM-using software in the wild actually look up the event log and
notice that it contains a 0?

This sucks.  How on Earth didn't the TPM2 spec do this instead of
having explicit handling for "a PCR got extended, and the code that
extended it didn't support a given bank, and therefore *the resulting
PCR value cannot be relied on*?  It would have been *one single bit
per PCR, bank* indicating that the PCR's value is incomplete, along
with some basic logic that an incomplete PCR cannot magically become
complete, nor can it be used to authorize anything unless the
authorization policy explicitly allows it?

Anyway, other than the fact that everyone (presumably?) expects
software to be aware of SHA-1 and (mostly) SHA256, and presumably
users of SM3 already expect that a lot of things don't support it,
SHA1 doesn't seem very different from SM3 in the sense that (a) people
might not want to support it and (b) the actual behavior of a boot
chain component that doesn't support a cryptosystem is FUNDAMENTALLY
DANGEROUS.

Is there explicit guidance from TCG as to how this is supposed to work?


In any case, I have a strawman suggestion to resolve this issue much
better from Linux's perspective.  It's a strawman because, while I
attempted to read the relevant part of the specs, the specs and the
ecosystem are a mess, so I could be wrong.

Linux should not use TPM2_PCR_Extend *at all*.  Instead, Linux should
exclusively use TPM2_PCR_Event.  I would expect that passing, say, the
entire kernel image to TPM2_PCR_Event would be a big mistake, so
instead Linux should hash the relevant data with a reasonable
suggestion of hashes (which includes, mandatorily, SHA-384 and *does
not* include SHA-1, and may or may not be configurable at build time
to include things like SM3), concatenate them, and pass that to
TPM2_PCR_Event.  And Linux should make the value that it passed to
TPM2_PCR_Event readily accessible to software using it, and should
also include some straightforward tooling to calculate it from a given
input so that software that wants to figure out what value to expect
in a PCR can easily do so.

And then software that wants to use a SHA-1 bank will work every bit
as well as it would if Linux actually implemented it, but Linux can
happily not implement it, and even users of oddball algorithms that
Linux has never heard of will get secure behavior.

(Why SHA-384?  Because it's mandatory in the TPM Client profile, and
anyone who's happy with SHA-256 should also be willing to accept
SHA-384.)

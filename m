All variants that use per-cpu workqueues.

Yes and adding WQ_UNBOUND to custom per-cpu workqueues.

We can rename APIs too and it's going to be a slog, which, to be fair, this
is going to be no matter what.

If we're renaming, I'd deprecate the schedule_*() interface and always use
queue_*() and maybe:

- Replace WQ_UNBOUND with its complement WQ_PERCPU.
- Add WQ_PREFER_PERCPU.
- Rename system_wq -> system_percpu_wq.
- Add system_prefer_percpu_wq.
- Rename system_unbound_wq -> system_dfl_wq.

I'm not sure allowing queueing on per-cpu worker on a different CPU would be
all that useful. Might as well just turn them into when necessary.

It's a correctness issue. We can't change the gurantees without auditing and
transitining the users.

Thanks.

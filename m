Hmm, I'm afraid it isn't that simple...  See, the entire thermal
framework is rather complex and there may be hidden issues, because
such handling of the cooldown events probably isn't the most common
variant on all boards supported upstream.

Even if everything is fine there, with the dynamic reassigning of
the cooldown thresholds and everything else, which hopefully is, :)
generating and handling the LT_INT interrupts, at the first glance,
requires rather major changes to the driver because it introduces
a different class of interrupts, for which the amount of required
changes isn't exactly small.

I totally agree that this patch needs to get merged first, perhaps
even as a v2 that would include "Cc: stable" as well.

Regarding adding support for LT_INT interrupts, frankly, I'd much
rather leave that do be done as part of my upcoming major rework
of the OPPs by introducing the SoC binning.  As part of that, I'll
do a whole lot of testing on different boards with different SoCs
and their different variants, which should ensure that everything
works as expected, including the LT_INT stuff.

Technically both, :) but of course, the primary goal would be to make
the CPU not do what it doesn't really have to, and spinning down the
fan faster would be just an additional benefit.  It isn't going to
make some huge difference in the CPU load (or better said, in the
"background noise"), but again, every tiny bit counts.

When it comes to the HT_INT interrupts, they're obviously much more
important, because there must not be any delays when (over)heating
happens.  That isn't so critical with the LT_INT interrupts, which
is probably the reason why the downstream kernel code uses HT_INT
interrupts only.

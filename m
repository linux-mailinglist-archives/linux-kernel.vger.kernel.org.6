Hi Kuai,

All right. I usually focus on MM, it seems there is a gap between MM and =
BLock.
Anyway, let's figure out if there is any good solution.

I didn't fully understand your suggestion. Let me ask some questions.
blk_mq_stop_hw_queue() is usually called in blk_mq_ops->queue_rq path,
it'll be easy for this case to pass the new status to =
blk_mq_run_dispatch_ops.
Should we remove blk_mq_stop_hw_queues() as well? How to pass the new
status to blk_mq_run_dispatch_ops in this case?

Actually, I didn't understand how to avoid the above race. May you =
elaborate
the scenario?

Muhcun,
Thanks.

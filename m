This looks good, but I guess arm_dsu (or others maybe..) has multiple
instances like arm_dsu_0, arm_dsu_1, and so on.  Then it should merge
the similar PMUs and print once.  Same thing for armv8_pmuv3.

But I think it's better to skip the events if we know the PMU doesn't
support sampling for sure.

Right, this is a problem but I'm not sure it handles the case
specifically as it just reported warning on any failures first.

If I've understood correctly, the aim here is to link all the current per-cpu
clusters for a given order together so that if a cpu can't allocate a new
cluster for a given order, then it can steal another CPU's current cluster for
that order?

If that's the intent, couldn't that be done just by iterating over the per-cpu,
per-order cluster pointers? Then you don't need all the linked list churn
(althogh I like the linked list changes as a nice cleanup, I'm not sure the
churn is neccessary for this change?). There would likely need to be some
locking considerations, but it would also allow you to get access to the next
entry within the cluster for allocation.

However, fundamentally, I don't think this change solves the problem; it just
takes a bit longer before the allocation fails. The real problem is
fragmentation due to freeing individual pages from swap entries at different times.

Wouldn't it be better to just extend scanning to support high order allocations?
Then we can steal a high order block from any cluster, even clusters that were
previously full, just like we currently do for order-0. Given we are already
falling back to this path for order-0, I don't think it would be any more
expensive; infact its less expensive because we only scan once for the high
order block, rather than scan for every split order-0 page.

Of course that still doesn't solve the proplem entirely; if swap is so
fragmented that there is no contiguous block of the required order then you
still have to fall back to splitting. As an extra optimization, you could store
the largest contiguous free space available in each cluster to avoid scanning in
case its too small?

This looks wrong to me; if the cluster is on the nonfull list then it will have
had some entries already allocated (by another cpu). So pointing tmp to the
first block in the cluster will never yield a free block. The cpu from which you
are stealing the cluster stores the next free block location in its per-cpu
structure. So perhaps iterating over the other cpu's `struct percpu_cluster`s is
a better approach than the nonfull list?

Additionally, this cluster will be stored back to this cpu's current cluster at
the bottom of the function. That may or may not be what you intended.

Yup, it's really more just a theoretical correctness concern - certainly 
Arm's implementations from MMU-700 onwards do support BBML2, while 
MMU-600 is now sufficiently old that nobody is likely to pair it with 
new BBML-capable CPUs anyway - so it's just to cover the gap that in 
principle there may be 3rd-party implementations which might get confused.

Cheers,
Robin.

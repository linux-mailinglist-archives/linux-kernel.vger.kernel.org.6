I really think "time elapsed since the last flush" is the right solution
here.  As, we *do* want to catch the case you describe "two flushes
happened to be requested in close succession and the flushing rate is
generally low."

(After this patch fixing the lock contention triggered by kswapd).
The remaining problem with kswapd is that those flushes that doesn't
"collide" on the lock, will be flushing in close succession.  And we
likely have a generally low flushing rate, until kswapd starts up.

Some production data from a "slow" period where only kswapd is active:

05:59:32 @ongoing_flusher_cnt[kswapd11]: 1
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[kswapd7]: 1
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[kswapd3]: 1
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[kswapd5]: 1
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[kswapd10]: 1
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[kswapd6]: 2
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[kswapd8]: 2
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[kswapd1]: 2
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[kswapd9]: 2
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[kswapd0]: 2
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[kswapd2]: 2
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[kswapd4]: 2
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[handled_race]: 2
@ongoing_flusher_cnt[all]: 14
@cnt[tracepoint:cgroup:cgroup_rstat_lock_contended]: 2
@cnt[tracepoint:cgroup:cgroup_ongoing_flusher_wait]: 10
@cnt[kfunc:vmlinux:cgroup_rstat_flush_locked]: 43
@cnt[tracepoint:cgroup:cgroup_rstat_locked]: 51

We observe that ongoing_flusher scheme saves/avoids 14 of the flushes
great, but we still have 43 flushes in this period.  I think only kswapd
is doing the flushing here, so I claim 41 flushes are likely unnecessary
(as there are indication of 2 kswapd startups in the period).  Also
observe that some of the kswapdNN processes only have
ongoing_flusher_cnt 1, which indicate they didn't fully "collide" with
an ongoing flusher, while others have 2.

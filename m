I get your point on that one. But let me explain a bit more why I think that
check is not overly helpful here.

In Rust we have the concept of marking functions as 'unsafe'. Unsafe functions
need to document their safety preconsitions, i.e. the conditions the caller of
the function must guarantee. The caller of an unsafe function needs an unsafe
block for it to compile and every unsafe block needs an explanation why it is
safe to call this function with the corresponding arguments.

(Ideally, we want to avoid having them in the first place, but for C abstractions
we have to deal with raw pointers we receive from the C side and dereferencing a
raw pointer is unsafe by definition.)

In this case we have a function that constructs the Rust `Device` structure from
a raw (device) pointer we potentially received from the C side. Now we have to
decide whether this function is going to be unsafe or safe.

In order for this function to be safe we would need to be able to guarantee that
this is a valid, non-null pointer with a non-zero reference count, which
unfortunately we can't. Hence, it's going to be an unsafe function.

A NULL pointer check would not make it a safe function either, since the pointer
could still be an invalid one, or a pointer to a device it's not guaranteed that
the reference count is held up for the duration of the function call.

Given that, we could add the NULL check and change the safety precondition to
"valid pointer to a device with non-zero reference count OR NULL", but I don't
see how this improves the situation for the caller, plus we'd need to return
`Result<Device>` instead and let the caller handle that the `Device` was not
created.

I'm just saying the caller has to validate that or provide a rationale why this
is safe anyways, hence it'd be just a duplicate check.

It mostly calls into C functions with this pointer, depends on what they do.

Checking a few random places, e.g. [1], it seems to crash in most cases.

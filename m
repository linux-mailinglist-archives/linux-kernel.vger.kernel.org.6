So I try to be agnostic on the issue but we got to this point because
of events being broken on ARM Apple chips. I fixed an issue where the
ARM core PMU appeared as an uncore PMU as ARM's PMU naming differs
from everyone else's. That fix made it so we used legacy events for
the ARM core PMU, the PMU driver didn't handle this correctly (at the
time) on ARM Apple Linux breaking perf over multiple Linux releases
affecting a number of users.

Having a pool of standard events isn't on the face of it a crazy idea,
I'll try to remember things that have come up:

1) instructions and cycles seem like fairly easy events to agree upon.
However, we also have cpu-cycles that means cycles. With legacy events
the hyphen is often used as a PMU separator. Now what does the cpu
mean here? On ARM you also have cpu_cycles as a sysfs event, ie an
underscore and not a hyphen:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools-next.git/tr=
ee/drivers/perf/arm_pmuv3.c?h=3Dperf-tools-next#n192
What does 'cpu' mean when ARM has no core PMU called 'cpu' and in
heterogeneous systems there are multiple notions of 'cpu' for the core
PMU.
What's my point? Just trying to make a minimal 2 event set of common
events with the way things currently parse leads to ambiguity.

2) missing/ambiguous legacy events. Beyond instructions and cycles
there are cache references, cache misses, branch instructions, branch
misses, bus cycles, stalled cycles frontend, stalled cycles backend
and reference CPU cycles. This set of events captures an out-of-order
machine with a single bus, but even then there's ambiguity over
whether the events include speculatively executed instructions or not.
What's my point? Using these events leads to unpredictable counts in
software. With a sysfs/json event there is a description but none was
ever given about what these legacy events should do, or do if you have
a system with >1 bus, counts for speculatively executed instructions,
isn't out-of-order, etc.

3) "legacy cache" events never really took off. The legacy cache event
names encoded data around speculation and appeared less ambiguous, a
good source for all the names supported by perf is here:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools-next.git/tr=
ee/tools/perf/util/evsel.c?h=3Dperf-tools-next#n734
but choices were made like prefetch is the same as a speculative read
in the encoding. Vendors no doubt agree and disagree on this. LLC and
L2 are synonyms, but today LLC generally means L3 and often an
entirely separate PMU.
What's my point? The code tried to do a smarter less ambiguous thing
than PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE with PERF_TYPE_HW_CACHE but again it was
flawed, carried too many architectural assumptions and without the
drivers adopting it neither did users.

4) PMU drivers mapping issues and the aforementioned ARM Apple Linux
breakage, RISC-V wanting to keep mappings out of a more simplistic
driver.

So I wasn't there for all of this, but I think this is what led to the
legacy events effectively becoming deprecated.

Agreed, that's why I keep saying I'm only doing this because ARM and
RISC-V want it. What I want is that for things like the encoding of
"cpu-cycles" and "cpu/cpu-cycles/" when there is only 1 PMU providing
such an event called "cpu" the perf_event_attr encodings should match,
we don't have this today but did prior to changing the priority to fix
the ARM Apple Linux issue.

I think for what Atish is asking for perhaps the best route is to add
vendor standard events like ARM has. Anything done in Linux won't
carry over to other operating systems you can be trying to virtualize.
This doesn't to me feel like a problem we should be trying to solve
either in the kernel/driver or the tool, well I've not heard an idea
how we can.

So for heterogeneous chips ARM first did BIG.little over ten years
ago. More recently Intel did hybrid and it wasn't until Intel added
hybrid support for legacy events that the idea of this worked. As you
know, ARM''s support came later. Does software outside of the perf
tool know to encode information in the extended type information in
legacy events? I doubt it. For example, libpfm4 has only recently been
adding support for heterogeneous CPUs.

So yes there are legacy events and they are a common pool of events
which is convenient for developers, however, this approach quickly
showed shortcomings and often lacked proper vendor support. My company
advocates developers against using common events, which admittedly is
more work for the developer, because we've had multiple issues over
the years primarily due to baked in assumptions.

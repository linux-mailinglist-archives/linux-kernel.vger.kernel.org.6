From: Baokun Li <libaokun1@huawei.com>

Hi all!

This patch series is a hardening of ext4 extents path related code.

This is the second version of this patch series. Thank you, Jan Kara and
Ojaswin Mujoo, for the feedback in the previous version. The new version
has no functional changes compared to the previous one, so I've kept the
previous Reviewed-by, please let me know if you have any objections.

The following is a brief overview of the patches, see the patches for
more details.

Patch 1-2: Refactor ext4_ext_rm_idx() as suggested by Jan, and add
appropriate error handling branches to ext4_ext_rm_idx() and
ext4_ext_correct_indexes() to avoid inconsistent extents tree.
 PS: This comes from the previous work of my colleague zhanchengbin
 (see link), who is no longer in charge of these and I have taken over.
 Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230213080514.535568-3-zhanchengbin1@huawei.com/

Patch 3-7: Quick fixes for use-after-free and double-free problems caused
by mixing path(pointer to an extent path) and ppath(pointer to an extent
path pointer).

Patch 8-9: Fix an issue that caused p_bh to be released twice if it wasn't
set to NULL after path->p_bh was released. And add a helper function after
the quick fix to prevent this from happening again.

Patch 10: Fix an issue where the error returned by ext4_find_extent in
ext4_insert_range() was not propagated correctly.

Patch 11-22: Now the use of path and ppath is so confusing that we can
trigger use-after-free or double-free by accessing a stale pointer, or
we can get a memory leak by forgetting to update ppath. And it's very
difficult to read the code. So to make the code more readable, get rid
of ppath and pass path between functions uniformly to avoid these risks.

Patch 23-24: Reduces the consumption of unnecessary memory operations by
avoiding repetitive allocation and release extents path.

Patch 25ï¼šClean up ext4_ext_create_new_leaf() to reduce some unnecessary
indentation and line breaks.

"kvm-xfstests -c ext4/all -g auto" has been executed with no new failures.
Randomly injecting faults(EIO, ENOMEM, Realloc Path) in ext4_find_extent()
while executing xfstests also did not observe new Oops.

Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
Please let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Baokun

Changes since v1:
 * Collect RVB from Honza and Ojaswin.(Thanks for your review!)
 * Patch 5: A quick fix has been added for a null pointer or memory leak
   that could be caused by ppath remaining NULL when path is reallocated.
 * Patch 6: Added a quick fix for the UAF that could be caused by a path
   not being updated when the ppath is reallocated.(Spotted by Ojaswin)
 * Patch 8: Correct the trace stack in commit message.(Spotted by Ojaswin)
 * Patch 10: Quick fixes split from Patch 15 to be easily pulled into
   stable.(Suggested by Honza)
 * Patch 23: A refactoring split from Patch 16 for easy review.(Suggested
   by Ojaswin)
 * Patch 24: Modify the patch subject.
 * Patch 25: Added cleanup patch to remove unnecessary indentation and
   line breaks in ext4_ext_create_new_leaf().(Suggested by Honza)
 * Adjust the sequence of patches.

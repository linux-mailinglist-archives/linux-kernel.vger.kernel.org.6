Hi David,

Thanks for taking a look at the patches!

We're trying to allocate a kernel memory that is accessible to the kernel but
only when the context of the process is loaded.

So this is a kernel memory that is not needed to operate the kernel itself, it
is to store & process data on behalf of a process. The requirement for this
memory is that it would never be touched unless the process is scheduled on this
core. otherwise any other access will crash the kernel.

So this memory should only be directly readable and writable by the kernel, but
only when the process context is loaded. The memory shouldn't be readable or
writable by the owner process at all.

This is basically done by removing those pages from kernel linear address and
attaching them only in the process mm_struct. So during context switching the
kernel loses access to the secret memory scheduled out and gain access to the
new process secret memory.

This generally protects against speculation attacks, and if other process managed
to trick the kernel to leak data from memory. In this case the kernel will crash
if it tries to access other processes secret memory.

Since this memory is special in the sense that it is kernel memory but only make
sense in the term of the owner process, I tried in this patch series to explore
the possibility of reusing memfd_secret() to allocate this memory in user virtual
address space, manage it in a VMA, flipping the permissions while keeping the
control of the mapping exclusively with the kernel.

Right now it is:
(a) Pages not accessible by user space -- even though they are mapped into user
    space, the PTEs are marked for kernel usage.
(b) Pages accessible by kernel space -- even though they are not mapped into the
    direct map, the PTEs in uvaddr are marked for kernel usage.
(c) copy_from / copy_to user won't fail -- because it is in the user range, but
    this can be fixed by allocating specific range in user vaddr to this feature
    and check against this range there.
(d) The secret memory vaddr is guessable by the owner process -- that can also
    be fixed by allocating bigger chunk of user vaddr for this feature and
    randomly placing the secret memory there.
(e) Mapping is off-limits to the owner process by marking the VMA as locked,
    sealed and special.

Other alternative (that was implemented in the first submission) is to track those
allocations in a non-shared kernel PGD per process, then handle creating, forking
and context-switching this PGD.

What I like about the memfd_secret() approach is the simplicity and being arch
agnostic, what I don't like is the increased attack surface by using VMAs to
track those allocations.

I'm thinking of working on a PoC to implement the first approach of using a
non-shared kernel PGD for secret memory allocations on arm64. This includes
adding kernel page table per process where all PGDs are shared but one which
will be used for secret allocations mapping. And handle the fork & context
switching (TTBR1 switching(?)) correctly for the secret memory PGD.

What do you think? I'd really appreciate opinions and possible ways forward.

Thanks!
Fares.

Depends on "how much" for sure. huge_memory.c is currently on place 12 
of the biggest files in mm/. So there might not be immediate cause for 
action ... just yet :) [guess which file is on #2 :) ]

Yes, that's what I mean.

I've been recently thinking if we should pursue a different direction:

Just as we recently relocated most follow_huge_* stuff into gup.c, 
likely we should rather look into moving copy_huge_pmd, change_huge_pmd, 
copy_huge_pmd ... into the files where they logically belong to.

In madvise.c, we've been doing that in some places already: For 
madvise_cold_or_pageout_pte_range() we inline the code, but not for 
madvise_free_huge_pmd().

pmd_trans_huge() would already compile to a NOP without 
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE, but to make that code avoid most 
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE, we'd need a couple more function stubs to 
make the compiler happy while still being able to compile that code out 
when not required.

The idea would be that e.g., pmd_leaf() would return "false" at compile 
time if no active configuration (THP, HUGETLB, ...) would be active. So 
we could just use pmd_leaf() similar to pmd_trans_huge() in relevant 
code and have the compiler optimize it all out without putting it into 
separate files.

That means, large folios and PMD/PUD mappings will become "more common" 
and better integrated, without the need to jump between files.

Just some thought about an alternative that would make sense to me.

Yes, likely. FSDAX went a similar direction and called that FSDAX thing 
a "THP" whereby it really doesn't have anything in common with a THP, 
besides being partially mappable -- IMHO.

Speaking to the "what is the goal" question, I think Greg talks about it
a bit[1], but I see the goal as eliminating memory safety issues in new
drivers and subsystems. The pattern we've seen in Linux (via syzkaller,
researchers, in-the-wild exploits, etc) with security flaws is that
the majority appear in new code. Focusing on getting new code written
in Rust puts a stop to these kinds of flaws, and it has an exponential
impact, as Android and Usenix have found[2] (i.e. vulnerabilities decay
exponentially).

In other words, I don't see any reason to focus on replacing existing
code -- doing so would actually carry a lot of risk. But writing *new*
stuff in Rust is very effective. Old code is more stable and has fewer
bugs already, and yet, we're still going to continue the work of hardening
C, because we still need to shake those bugs out. But *new* code can be
written in Rust, and not have any of these classes of bugs at all from
day one.

The other driving force is increased speed of development, as most of
the common bug sources just vanish, so a developer has to spend much
less time debugging (i.e. the "90/90 rules" fades). Asahi Lina discussed
this a bit while writing the M1 GPU driver[3], "You end up reducing the
amount of possible bugs to worry about to a tiny number"

So I think the goal is simply "better code quality", which has two primary
outputs: exponentially fewer security flaws and faster development speed.

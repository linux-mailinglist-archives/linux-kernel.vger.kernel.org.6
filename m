I think following the x86 behaviour is probably the best place to start:
the CPU that ends up doing the IPI will spin anyway, so I don't think
there's much to gain by being pro-active on the recipient.

Ok.

I don't have a strong preference, but I think I'd prefer a non-NMI first
as it feels like things ought to be more robust in that case and it
should work most of the time.

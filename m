Many thx!

As a result, Hao sent another patch to remove MT7921 from that rule(Bluetooth: btmtk: Remove resetting mt7921 before downloading the fw).

Great, but due to the kernel's "no regressions" rule this is mostly
irrelevant, as the regression must be fixed in a way that does not
require users to change their firmware.

So is any such solution in sight? Or should we just revert
ccfc8948d7e4d9 and any related follow up patches for now? Or would that
just cause regressions for other users?

Ciao, Thorsten

I think the list is fine as-is. If we already had support for the 'i' 
version and then added new 'iX' versions, then having the fallback makes 
sense. But since this is all new and defined at one time, I don't think 
defining all those combinations buys us anything. And an OS can still 
choose to only support the 'i' features even if the h/w supports the e, 
s, and/or w features.

The issue is that airoha only has 1 implementation of safexcel, not any 
of them which is what you defined. Well, at least if that's an SoC 
specific compatible which it doesn't look like either.

The issue is that you probably don't have an actual user for all the 
variants. I would just list them commented out or like this:

items:
  - false (tools might complain with this. "not: {}" may work instead)
  - enum:
      # IP versions without an SoC specific compatible defined yet
      - inside-secure,safexcel-eip93i
      - inside-secure,safexcel-eip93ie
      - inside-secure,safexcel-eip93is
      - inside-secure,safexcel-eip93ies
      - inside-secure,safexcel-eip93iw

(So remove the one you use in this list)

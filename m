Believe it or not, the same thoughts crossed my mind.  However,
after thinking a bit about it, I concluded that renaming the pinctrl
dtsi files as well makes the overall naming of the reworked RK3588
dtsi files more consistent.

It's also rather neat to have the "common" and "fullfat" file pairs
together in the arch/arm64/boot/dts/rockchip directory listing, when
it's sorted by the file name, which is the default in most (if not
all) environments.

Yeah, I resorted to "fullfat" as some kind of a funny option. :)
That's for the "beefy" SoC variants, so it kind of fits well. :)

The trouble with including "devices" into the filenames is, well,
the fact that those files isn't about any devices, but about the
SoC variants.  Thus, "devices" simply wouldn't fit there.

Moreover, in the envisioned scheme there should be no separate
OPP .dtsi files;  the OPP data should go directly into the new
rk3588.dtsi, rk3588s.dtsi and rk3588j.dtsi files, where it actually
belongs.  That's why those .dtsi files exist and are mostly empty,
at least the way I see it.  I'll get back to this below.

Such a layout, in general, has also crossed my mind, but my conclusion
was that having the per-SoC-variant OPP data specified directly in the
reworked rk3588.dtsi, rk3588s.dtsi and rk3588j.dtsi files is a better
option in the long term, even if we end up that way with rk3588.dtsi and
rk3588s.dtsi repeating most (if not all) of the same OPP data.

That way we'll have no roadblocks if, at some point, we end up with 
having
different OPPs defined for the RK3588 and the RK3588S variants.  Or 
maybe
even for the RK3582, which we don't know much about yet.

Yeah, that bothered me as well. :/  Unfortunately, I don't think that
much can be done there, but I'll try fiddling with the values for the
--find-renames parameter for git-diff(1).

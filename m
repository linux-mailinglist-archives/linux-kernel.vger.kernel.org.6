Yes, it works.

This proposal is similar to our original discussion about adding a
shutdown() callback along with release(). With this change, we can also drop [1].

It seems like the easiest solution. I'll add close_context().

True, the tee-supplicant can be terminated, but the client cannot be if it's
waiting for a trusted supplicant response. That's reasonable.

However, in qcomtee, both the client and supplicant can be threads within
a single process. If the process is killed, the supplicant thread can
go away, leaving the client stuck waiting. Therefore, in qcomtee, the
client also needs to be killable.

True, but there's a corner case due to the TASK_KILLABLE flag.

In optee, when a request is placed in the "supplicant queue" supp->reqs
(passing the access right to the supplicant), the client won't touch the request
until notified by the supplicant.

In qcomtee, besides the notification from the supplicant, we also accept
fatal signals. This causes the client to access the request without any
notification from supplicant, violating the exclusive access assumption.

The use of the srcu was not for correctness, and purely for the sake of
performance. Most of our internal tests are micro tests for the API at
the moment, so I do not have any number to support the argument :(.

I can stick to the ctx->lock and add srcu later if necessary when e2e
tests are active and I can collect some numbers? What do you think?

Best Regards,

Hello DAMON community,


Three more months have passed since the last DAMON quaterly news letter[0].
Let's look back what happened in the last three months.

Highlights of Highlights
========================

- New features.  DAMON-based CXL memory tiering patchset has merged[1] into the
  mainline.
- More users.  DAMON usages from AWS Aurora Serverless v2 has unveiled[6].
  CONFIG_DAMON has enabled[9] on Debian kernels.  Six more academic papers that
  exploring and/or utilizing DAMON has published or archived on OSDI[2,3],
  ATC[4,5], VLDB[6], and ArXiv[7].  Monthly PyPI downloads of DAMON user-space
  tool (DAMO) has significantly increase.
- Re:org.  DAMON github repos have moved[8] from awslabs org to damonitor org. 
- Conferences:   Detailed DAMON usages from products and labs have presented on
  OSS EU[10] and the VLDB paper[6].  Long-term DAMON plans for kernel that
  extensible and just works have shared and discussed[11] on LPC.

More detailed list of news per each month follows.

July 2024
=========

A couple of OSDI'24 papers[2,3] for memory tiering that references and
exploring DAMON as a part of them are published.

ATC'24 also published two DAMON-citing papers at the same time. The first
one[4] proposes a way to improve monitoring accuracy of DAMON, while the second
one[5] mentions DAMON can be useful for extensible memory management.

VLDB paper about Aurora Serverless V2, which reveals their usage of DAMON on
the product, is uploaded[6].

Memory Management subsystem pull request for Linux v6.11-rc1 with DAMON changes
for CXL memory tiering has merged[1].

August 2024
===========

GitHub repos for non-kernel parts of DAMON project including 'damo',
'damon-tests' and 'damoos' have announced[8] to be moved from awslabs org to
damonitor org.  As of this writing, the reorganization is completed.

September 2024
==============

CONFIG_DAMON is enabled[9] on Debian kernels.

An academic paper preprint that optimizes THP using DAMON and BPF has
uploaded[7] to ArXiv.

DAMON usages from labs and real-world products for profiling-guided
optimizations, proactive reclamation (Auroa Serverless v2), and CXL memory
tiering (SK hynix HMSDK) have shared[10] on Linux Conference at OSSummit EU'24.

DAMON long-term plans for making kernel extensible and just works have shared
and discussed on Kernel Memory Management Micro-Conference[11] at LPC'24.

Monthly PyPI downloads of DAMON user-space tool (DAMO) surpassed 4,000.  It
took about 7 months since the record of 2,000 (2024-02), which took about 18
months from the beginning.  The speed is apparently growing.

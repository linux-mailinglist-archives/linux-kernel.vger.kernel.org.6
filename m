The main clarification I was looking for was that in your design you
don't use any resources on the Linux side for when your remoteproc
instance is running - i.e. no carveouts etc on the Linux side.

No concerns with this, but these semantics should be clearly documented
here.

One example is drivers/remoteproc/qcom_q6v5_pas.c where this is captured
in adsp_start().

qcom_mdt_pas_init() parses out the ELF header and signature information
and passes this to the secure world, it then loads the segments of the
ELF into the carvouts (qcom_mdt_load_no_init()) and finally it jumps to
secure world with qcom_scm_pas_auth_and_reset(), which will lock down
Linux's access to the carveouts, then based on previously established
data will authenticate the loaded firmware and finally start execution
on the remote processor.

The difference in this model though is that we don't need the resource
table for rproc_handle_resources() - so this doesn't meet your needs.

Given that the ELF header and signature information is vetted before the
actually copy the segments into carveouts, it's conceivable that the ELF
header could be sanity checked...

Yes, but it needs to be pointed out that this is because you want the
resource table to be authenticated.

No, perhaps I'm misinterpreting you here; but the goal isn't to play
word games until it's good enough - the goal is to have a clean design
that will cover the various cases, and for that we need to establish
what your actual requirements on the host OS side is (typically while
considering the "other side" to be a black box).

This is valuable information related to TA_RPROC_CMD_LOAD_FW and
TA_RPROC_CMD_START_FW, so let's document this there instead.

I guess it's fine to define it like this on this level, but in the
remoteproc core I'd like us to express the related logic as "release
resources allocated durign rproc_parse_fw(). (And I don't think these
two interpretations are in conflict).

What's unexpected to me then is that you're not actually reloading your
firmware across a recovery/restart?

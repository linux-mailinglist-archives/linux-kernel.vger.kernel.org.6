No problem, I think I should also be more clear about the point.  Happy to have
a chance to develop my humble communication skill with the conversaions with
you.

I mind those.  Everything should work without regression in the middle of the
patchset.  Nonetheless, we should avoid only regression.  We don't need to make
everything perfect.  Let's minimize changes to the other modules in the way.

I believe below suggested patches flow and my second reply to the second patch
of this patchset can clarify the point.  Please let me know if not.

As I mentioned on my second reply to the second patch, you could swich patches
3 and 4 if you want trace events to work perfect from the beginning of
user-visible multi contexts support.

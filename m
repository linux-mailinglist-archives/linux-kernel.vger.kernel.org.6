Instead of necessary evil, I would call it a pragmatic approach i.e.
resolve the ongoing pain with good enough solution and work on long term
solution later.

Intentionally ignoring the significant change is fine for, as you said,
for irrelevant stats but also for the cases where we don't need the
exact and precise stats. See my next point.

I think I explained in the commit message why we don't need the precise
metrics for this specific case but let me reiterate.

The stats are needed for two specific heuristics in this case:

1. Deactivate LRUs
2. Cache trim mode

The deactivate LRUs heuristic is to maintain a desirable inactive:active
ratio of the LRUs. The specific stats needed are WORKINGSET_ACTIVATE*
and the hierarchical LRU size. The WORKINGSET_ACTIVATE* is needed to
check if there is a refault since last snapshot and the LRU size are
needed for the desirable ratio between inactive and active LRUs. See the
table below on how the desirable ratio is calculated.

/* total     target    max
 * memory    ratio     inactive
 * -------------------------------------
 *   10MB       1         5MB
 *  100MB       1        50MB
 *    1GB       3       250MB
 *   10GB      10       0.9GB
 *  100GB      31         3GB
 *    1TB     101        10GB
 *   10TB     320        32GB
 */

The desirable ratio only changes at the boundary of 1 GiB, 10 GiB,
100 GiB, 1 TiB and 10 TiB. There is no need for the precise and accurate
LRU size information to calculate this ratio. In addition, if
deactivation is skipped for some LRU, the kernel will force deactive on
the severe memory pressure situation.

For the cache trim mode, inactive file LRU size is read and the kernel
scales it down based on the reclaim iteration (file >> sc->priority) and
only checks if it is zero or not. Again precise information is not
needed.

This is indeed an issue but that is common with the heuristics in
general. They work most of the time and fail for small set of cases.

Anyways, I am not arguing to remove sync flush for all cases. Rather I
am arguing for this specific case, we don't need to be precise as I have
explained above.

Yes separate flushing for each subsystems make sense and can be done
orthogonally.

My main beef with the global mutex is the possible priority inversion.
Unless you agree to add try_lock() and skip flushing i.e. no one sleeps
on the mutex, this is a no go.

MGLRU simply don't use these heuristics (Yu Zhao please correct me if I
am wrong).

This is actually a good point. I remember Jasper telling that MEMCG_KMEM
might be the one with most updates. I can try to collect from Meta fleet
what is the cause of most updates.

Please note that this is not some user API which can not be changed
later. We can change and disect however we want. My only point is not to
wait for the perfect solution and have some intermediate and good enough
solution.

Thanks for the review.

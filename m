Yes; that's *why* I'm asking.

I do not believe that this assertion is correct.

I specifically gave the example of mutual exclusion against exception
handlers, and preempt_disable() ... preempt_disable() does not prevent
exceptions being taken, so disabling preemption *cannot* be sufficient
to provide mutual exclusion against exception handlers.

What prevents a race with an exception handler? e.g. 

* Does the structure of the code prevent that somehow?

* What context(s) does this code execute in?
  - Are debug exceptions always masked?
  - Do we disable breakpoints/watchpoints around (some) manipulation of
    the relevant registers?

As above, I do not believe this is correct. At minimum, disabling
preemption is not the full story here.

I've given some suggestions above. Please go and read the code and
figure this out.

Please go and read the code and figure this out.

Please go and read the code and figure this out.

I took a closer look and I believe my hotfix was actually unnecessary. I
sent it out in response to a syzbot report, but upon closer look it
seems like it was not an actual problem. Sorry if my patch confused you.

Looking at enum cpuhp_state in include/linux/cpuhotplug.h, it seems like
CPUHP_MM_ZSWP_POOL_PREPARE is in the PREPARE section. The comment above
says:

 * PREPARE: The callbacks are invoked on a control CPU before the
 * hotplugged CPU is started up or after the hotplugged CPU has died.

So even if we go into reclaim during zswap_cpu_comp_prepare(), it will
never be on the CPU that we are allocating resources for.

The other case where zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() could race with
compression/decompression is when a pool is being created. In this case,
reclaim from zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() can recurse into zswap on the same
CPU AFAICT. However, because the pool is still under creation, it will
not be used (i.e. zswap_pool_current_get() won't find it).

So I think we don't need to worry about zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() racing
with compression or decompression for the same pool and CPU.

As I mentioned above, when zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() is run we are in one
of two situations:
- The pool is under creation, so we cannot race with stores/loads from
  that same pool.
- The CPU is being onlined, in which case zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() is
  called from a control CPU before tasks start running on the CPU being
  onlined.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

Yeah this is point (1) above IIUC, and I agree about zero initialization

I believe this problem goes away with acomp_ctx->__online going away,
right?

I don't think this is necessary, see my comments above.

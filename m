?

Almost all architectures (that run Linux) use 64-bit addressing, both
32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

The former is correct.  The latter makes no sense at all!  The whole
point of the "bus" abstraction is that you get a new addressing domain
there.

Yes, these days you numerically find it most often with PCI sub-domains,
but those are boring.  In most cases you *do* have different adressing
on your child busses, and even if the addressing is the same, addresses
on the child bus are not normally a subset of those on the parent bus.

So *always* use the OF definition, at least on OF systems?  Where
everything is meant to conform, but conform to OF, not conform to this
"OF-like-but-very-different-in-crucial-spots" thing :-)

This makes sense to me. I like keeping the old apparent behavior unless
-v is used and it will feel like the tool "just works".

In the context of the commit summary "perf parse-events: Prefer
sysfs/JSON hardware events over legacy":

I don't follow why that should be "Prefer, even if it's an event that
can't be opened, sysfs/JSON...".

Surely it should be "Prefer sysfs/JSON, unless it can't be opened, then
use legacy". If all events can be opened, sure go and open them all. If
only core events can be opened, do that too. If only uncore events can
be opened... etc.

I'm happy to help with the implementation or testing of that on my
big.LITTLE system.

FWIW the hybrid stuff with Perf stat is already working well for me on
Arm since we added PERF_PMU_CAP_EXTENDED_HW_TYPE which Ian suggested.

Is the problem you are referring to that there are multiple PMUs with
'cycles' events? Surely that's only a problem in the context of the new
proposed behavior, otherwise it's not really a problem. It's just
something that happens to exist.

Because the user could always use the defaults (no argument) or -e
cycles and historically Perf correctly picked the one that could be
opened. Or if they want the DSU one they could specify it. That can all
still work _and_ we can support "prefer sysfs/JSON" as long as we don't
prefer it when opening the event doesn't work.

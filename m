By dropping the spinlock, you mean dropping the guard of the spinlock?

We do have `Guard::do_unlocked`, but it'll be rather difficult to
integrate that there.

I don't think this works, since one can just call `with_irqs_diabled`
twice:

    with_irqs_diabled(|irq1| {
        with_irqs_diabled(|irq2| {
            let some_guard =3D some_spinlockirq.lock_with(&irq1);

            let irq =3D irqs_on_and_sleep(irq2);

            some_function(some_guard.some_data);
        })
    })

Hi Konrad, Doug,

  Usually on downstream we set this quirk only for all Gen-1 targets 
(not particularly for this testcase) but to avoid these kind of 
controller going dead issues. I can filter out the gen-1 targets (other 
than sc7280/sc7180) and send a separate series to add this quirk in all 
of them.

Regards,
Krishna,

Sure, but honestly if you were to ask me in person, I would have given 
you the explanation as provided in the Secure Launch Overview in the 
documentation patch.

The SINIT ACM is provided a structure that basically says, here is an 
address and size of what it will execute next. It will use that 
information to take its transitive trust measurement of the kernel 
before handing control to the Linux kernel. The Secure Launch code is 
responsible for ensuring everything that can influences its execution to 
be measured and stored into the TPM for attestations to be made at a 
latter time. The most important part is the transitive trust measurement 
of the next part to be executed, the initramfs. Specifically, the Secure 
Launch code must be able to handle the situation where the initramfs 
independent of the kernel and loaded separately. Additionally, the 
policy function provided for optional system state to also be measured 
and recorded, as the attestation evaluator might want them.

At the end of the day, this capability is strictly a passive (mostly, 
see note [1] below) solution with the responsibility to maintain the 
DRTM trust chain by taking meaningful measurements. This includes the 
next component in the trust chain and then hand execution to that next 
component.

The TCG specs and good practices provide that a component in either SRTM 
or DRTM trust chains should extend a non-event record to the tpm and/or 
its log. This is to indicate the transition point from one component in 
the trust chain to the next component. Under the client profile, 
firmware is required to do this by extending an event of type 
EV_SEPARATOR before "Ready to Boot".

I did not see the term actually defined in the client profile, but the 
term "cap" refers to the specific action of hashing a value across a set 
of PCRs. This is to reflect that certain events have occurred and will 
result in a different but predictable change to the PCR value. Often 
times this is to ensure that if there are TPM objects sealed to the 
system with either that event having or have not occurred, they cannot 
be unsealed. Thus, one has "capped" the PCRs as a means to close access 
to the “acceptable” system state.

To close and reiterate, Secure Launch only responsibility is to send 
measurements to the TPM. The TPM and TPM driver has an expectation that 
every PCR extend event contains a hash for every active algorithm bank. 
For Secure Launch, to send SHA1 measurements has zero impact on the 
security of the system. Whether those measurements are used for TPM 
integrity reporting and security policy enforcement by user space or an 
enterprise is outside the scope of the Secure Launch capability and the 
kernel.

[1] A future expansion of Secure Launch will be to enable usage of 
Intel's Hardware Shield, link below, to provide runtime trustworthy 
determination of SMM. The full extent of this capability can only be 
achieved under a DRTM launch of the system with Intel TXT. When enabled,
this can be used to verify the SMM protections are in place and inform 
the kernel's memory management which regions of memory are safe from SMM 
tampering.

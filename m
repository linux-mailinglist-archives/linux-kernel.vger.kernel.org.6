Yes, the buffer allocation is the tricky bit.  Audit does preallocate
some structs for tracking names which ideally should handle the vast
majority of the cases, but yes, we need something to handle all of the
corner cases too without having to resort to audit_panic().

I believe using task_work will cause a number of challenges for the
audit subsystem as we try to bring everything together into a single
audit event.  We've had a lot of problems with io_uring doing similar
things, some of which are still unresolved.

I've got some grand ideas on how to cut down on a lot of our
allocations and string generation in the critical path, not just with
the inodes, but with audit records in general.  Sadly I just haven't
had the time to get to any of it.

I'm not as current on the third-party security requirements as I used
to be, but I do know that oftentimes when a file is created the parent
directory is an important bit of information to have in the audit log.

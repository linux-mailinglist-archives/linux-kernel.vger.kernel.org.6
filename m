Sounds right, also in this case the ownership of the page stays with
drm/msm which might also make it easy to handle the page for them.

Sure Rob get it. Previously in v11 I sent a patch adding a 
adreno-smmu-priv api with similar "page allocation in drm" design as you 
explained
above. Is that approach looking okay?
If it's okay can I add you in
suggested-by tag in that patch

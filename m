Bah. I mean, I understand why, they *are* pointers after all. But to
then also discard the object size is just silly. I mean, traditionally C
doesn't give a crap about object size -- it is irrelevant.

But with alias analysis (which we switch off) and doubly so with this
fortify stuff, you do care about it.

So why throw it out?

Makes sense.

And that's just daft :/

:-( This just doesn't make sense. How can you be so inconsistent about
things.

What will actually break if you 'fix' this? Given that inlining (see
below) changes the rules willy nilly, I feel we can (and should!) just
fix this.

*sigh* yes ofcourse, inlineing in C is a mess, it really does change the
meaning of what you've written.

Combine this with the fact that 'inline' doesn't actually mean anything
much these days because the compiler will do whatever it feels like
anyway, and you've got a language that's like *really* hard to use.

Hence our noinline and __always_inline attributes to force it where we
need to.

WTF ?!?! How can all this be so inconsistent and why are people okay
with that?

So I'm not entirely sure I agree with that argument. Yes, &regs->bx is
'unsigned long *' and sizeof(unsigned long) is 8 (if we assume 64bit).
However, you can also read it as the point of pt_regs where bx sits --
which is a far more sensible interpretation IMO.

Because then we're looking at struct pt_regs and an offset therein.

So really pt_regs *is* an array of unsigned long, and I feel it is
really unfortunate we cannot express this in a way that is more concise.

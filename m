For the ext4 file system, s_journal_inum is fixed after mkfs and is not
expected to be modified. However, the sbi->s_sbh buffer head belongs to
the block device, so direct write operations to the file system's block
device /dev/xxx may directly modify sbi->s_sbh.

For example, you can use the following script to trigger a journal bmap
failure:

mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sda
mount /dev/sda /tmp/test
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=4096 count=1
echo 1 > /tmp/test/file
umount /tmp/test

(Adding a delay in put_super and performing the script during the delay
  can trigger the issue described in the patch.)

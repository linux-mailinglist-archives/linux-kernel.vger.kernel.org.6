So I'm having a hard time parsing this reply.  And I don't think you
make a good case for leaving or even having a BUG_ON() here at all.
If there's a chance of it hitting in the wild, it should be removed.
But you don't want to remove it because it will never hit?  That's
just lazy... :-)   I just don't see why a filesystem should have the
opportunity to kill an entire system because that one filesystem has
problems.

Sure.

Right.

Thanks for your feedback!

Or even better: "Prepare RK3588 SoC dtsi files for per-variant OPPs"

Oh, the entire description of the patch was cobbled together in a rather
"relaxed" way, because it was past 2 AM over here, :) and because it's 
just
an RFC patch.  For the final version of the patch, if we agree upon 
moving
it forward from the RFC status, I'll prepare a more "formal" description
that will be much more detailed and more accurate.

Good remark.  Will be described in the final patch description.

Thanks. :)

Another good remark.  Will be addressed in the final patch description.

I'll think about it.  I'm not crazy about "fullfat" either.

Omitting the "s" wasn't a typo.  It's just that rk3588s.dtsi served as
the base for other .dtsi files before, but it's now called 
rk3588-common.dtsi,
which makes its purpose a bit more self-descriptive, and separates it
from the actual SoC variants (S, J, M), which should also help a bit
with its self-descriptiveness.

Note that "common" is already used in the .dtsi filenames for some other
SoC families, which I actually took inspiration from.

Of course.  Again, more material for the final patch description.

Agreed.  Once again, more material for the final patch description.

I also don't like the size of the patch.  I just tried playing with
specifying different values for the --find-renames and --find-copies
options, but with no good results.  I'll have a look into the Git
source later, to see what's actually going on with those options.

The most "correct" Fixes tag would appear to be the one that first
introduced __counted_by itself (dd06e72e68bc) but __counted_by can never
be used at that original change because the test used __element_count__
as the attribute name, which never shipped in any compiler. So I would
argue that this change really does fix c8248faf3ca2 because that is the
point in time that needs this fix.

Yeah, I think the way compiler_attributes.h has operated so far with
regards to tests and such is working fine so far, no real need to switch
things up yet.

The only reason I generally do build tests plus compiler version checks
is due to certain vendor versions of clang, such as Android, which may
hijack the patch version and appear newer than they actually are.
However, now that I think about it, LLVM moving to GCC's minor
versioning scheme of 0 for the development / main branch and 1+ for
released versions should avoid that issue, so it isn't strictly
necessary for that reason. However...

This is a good point, as technically to allow use of __counted_by with
GCC with a version check, it would need to be 150000, which would
potentially break GCC versions between the 15 version bump and landing
__counted_by support without the feature check. We could also just do
150100 to be simple about it but I am not sure that is worth doing,
since I believe it is important that we support using __counted_by with
prerelease GCC. We want to make sure that this attribute gets decent
testing coverage while in development.

We could ship this with a comment to simplify the check when GCC 15.1.0
is released, since this is a feature very unlikely to be backported to
earlier GCC releases?

Cheers,
Nathan


I guess since we have a hard version check for clang, we might as well
have one for GCC as well.

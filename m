Ohk. So even after clearing SB_ACTIVE flag, we still have FS operations
running like ext4_evict_inode which can race with the super block update
work starting a txn. 

Thanks for catching that scenario.

Thanks Jan for the suggestion. I now see what you meant by having an sbi
flag. Since that is local to ext4, we can set it just before flushing
the workqueue and we know that there won't be any update super block
work which can start a txn after flushing is complete. This flag can
then be used to check in any of the error handling paths to decide on
whether to schedule a new update work or not for updating sb.

This makes sense. Thanks for the review!

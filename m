Is this supported in mainline Linux? MTD handles the bad blocks and the
bad block tables, so I don't understand how this hardware feature can
live together with MTD.

Anyway, you are talking about MMCs, I don't understand why there are
bad blocks, nor what is checking them and when. This is all still very
fuzzy to me, I'm sorry.

Okay, why not, it's easier for ROMs to access it I guess.

This is what I don't understand. You can very well access your block
device by offset, why do you need the mtd interface at all?

I still don't understand the need for going through MTD tbh.

Why?

MTD also registers into NVMEM, so this is nice if you need both, but if
what you need is some NVMEM area derived dynamically and you register
into MTD for that, then no, I'm sorry, that's not the correct approach.

A kernel kexecing into another will generally use IMA if it wants to
measure into the TPM, which will use PCR 10 by default and not conflict
with the firmware PCRs (and you then use the IMA integrity log, which is
passed over a kexec, to work out the kexec side of things).

You still need the firmware event log in that case because the
"bootloader" kernel combo you load is measured into the TPM by the
firmware.

You _could_ technically configure things up to re-use some of the
firmware PCRs, but it generally wouldn't make a lot of sense to do so
and I've not seen any examples of that sort of configuration.

Well you could still want a
"IO performance always beats power considerations" and still go HMP because
sometimes for non-IO you prefer power, but I agree that we don't have enough
information about what the user wants from the system/kernel.

See below but also
"the requester need to move up to ensure the overall IO perf is better" is
just not true, with asynchronous IO submission done right, the submission
runtime isn't critical to the IO throughput, therefore it should run the
most power-efficient way.
This can be observed e.g. with any io_uring fio workload with significant
iodepth (and possibly multi-threading).
Completion may be a different story, depending on the device stack, if we're
dealing with !MCQ then the completion path (irq + block layer completion)
is absolutely critical.
For any mmc / ufs<4.0 system the performance difference between
fio --name=little --filename=/dev/sda --runtime=10 --rw=randread --bs=4k --ioengine=io_uring --numjobs=4 --iodepth=32 --group_reporting --cpus_allowed=$LITTLE_CPUS
and
fio --name=big --filename=/dev/sda --runtime=10 --rw=randread --bs=4k --ioengine=io_uring --numjobs=4 --iodepth=32 --group_reporting --cpus_allowed=$BIG_CPUS
is (usually) only because of the completion path and setting irq affinity of
/dev/sda to $BIG_CPUS will make the difference disappear (rq_affinity=0 and
implying LLC is the same).
Running the submission on little CPUs will usually be the most power-efficient
way then.

So if I understood Manish correctly the only reason they want the completion
to run on a bigger CPU than the submission is because the submission is already
saturating the CPU, therefore utilization of submission is no issue whatsoever.
They don't want to run (submission) on big though because of power
considerations.

Anyway, Manish's problem should be solved by rq_affinity=0 in that case (with
irq affinities set to big CPU then the completion will be run on the irq CPU)
and "rq_affinity=1 <=> equal capacity CPU" is the correct interpretation, is that
more or less agreed upon now?

In OP-TEE,  we does not store firmware segments informationa.  When we come
back fromTA_RPROC_FW_CMD_LOAD_FW request we have lost load information.
only the address of the resource table is stored.

that's correct.

Please tell me if I misunderstood, your proposal seems similar to the version 13
[1][2] of my series.

In the version v13 patch 3/7:
- the rproc_tee_parse_fw() that implements the rproc:ops:parse_fw loads
  the firmware and gets the resource table.
- the rproc_load_segment() is not optional in remoteproc-tee. We need to
  reload the firmware on recovery. For that we send twice the
  TA_RPROC_FW_CMD_LOAD_FW command to OP-TEE (on rproc_parse_fw and on
  then rproc_load_segment)
  OP-TEE just ignors the command if the firmware is already loaded.


In the v13 the resource release was something that trig Mathieu's concerns[3]
resulting in the V15 approach with 2 loads ops.


Could you confirm that the proposal in V13 is what you have in mind?
If Yes, and Mathieu is also ok to come back on v13 approach, I will use the V13
as base, for my next version integrating other comments and improving the
release part.

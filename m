Yeah, it's not a trivial thing. I.e. I guess things like sysfs and
procfs will retain ownership/access mode. sysctls and sysfs attrs are
going to retain their most recently written contents and things like
that. Synthetic network interfaces, DM devices, loopback devices all
would survive this.

So, no idea how realistic this is, but I would *love* it, not only for
this purpose here, but also for the "soft-reboot" logic we have in
system these days, which shuts down userspace and starts it up again,
as a form of super-fast reboot that doesn't replace the kernel. If we
could reliably reset sysfs/sysctl/procfs/… during this, this would be
really lovely.

I tried monitoring the access patterns on the physical address space of a
system running a real-world server workload.  I was able to reproduce the
reported poor quality of hot pages detection using default parameter.  And I
was also able to improve the quality following the above tuning guide.  I'm
sharing the details as an example.

5ms/100ms intervals: Reproduce Problem
--------------------------------------

Initially, I captured the access pattern snapshot on the physical address
space using DAMON, with the default interval parameters (5 milliseconds and 100
milliseconds for the sampling and the aggregation intervals, respectively).  I
wait ten minutes after starting DAMON, to show a meaningful time-wise access
patterns.

```
# damo start
# sleep 600
# damo record --snapshot 0 1
# damo stop
```

Then, I listed the DAMON-found regions of different access patterns, sorted by
the access temperature.  Access temperature is
calculated (https://github.com/damonitor/damo/blob/v2.5.8/src/damo_report_access.py#L643)
as a weighted sum of the access frequency and the age of the region.  If the
access frequency is 0 %, the temperature is multipled by minus one.  That is,
if a region is not accessed, it gets minus temperature and it gets lower as not
accessed for longer time.  The sorting is in temperature-ascendint order, so
the region at the top of the list is the coldest, and the one at the bottom is
the hottest one.

```
# damo report access --sort_regions_by temperature
0   addr 16.052 GiB   size 5.985 GiB   access 0 %   age 5.900 s    # coldest
1   addr 22.037 GiB   size 6.029 GiB   access 0 %   age 5.300 s
2   addr 28.065 GiB   size 6.045 GiB   access 0 %   age 5.200 s
3   addr 10.069 GiB   size 5.983 GiB   access 0 %   age 4.500 s
4   addr 4.000 GiB    size 6.069 GiB   access 0 %   age 4.400 s
5   addr 62.008 GiB   size 3.992 GiB   access 0 %   age 3.700 s
6   addr 56.795 GiB   size 5.213 GiB   access 0 %   age 3.300 s
7   addr 39.393 GiB   size 6.096 GiB   access 0 %   age 2.800 s
8   addr 50.782 GiB   size 6.012 GiB   access 0 %   age 2.800 s
9   addr 34.111 GiB   size 5.282 GiB   access 0 %   age 2.300 s
10  addr 45.489 GiB   size 5.293 GiB   access 0 %   age 1.800 s    # hottest
total size: 62.000 GiB
```

The list shows not seemingly hot regions, and only minimum access pattern
diversity.  Every region has zero access frequency.  The number of region is
10, which is the default `min_nr_regions` value.  Size of each region is also
nearly idential.  We can suspect this is because "adaptive regions adjustment"
mechanism was not well working.  As the guide suggested, we can get relative
hotness of regions using 'age' as the recency information.  That would be
better than nothing, but given the fact that the longest age is only about 6
seconds while we waited about ten minuts, it is unclear how useful this will
be.

The temperature ranges to total size of regions of each range histogram
visualization (https://github.com/damonitor/damo/blob/v2.5.7/USAGE.md#access-report-styles)
of the results also shows no interesting distribution pattern.

```

```

In short, the result is very similar to the reported problems: poor quality
monitoring results for hot regions detection.  According to the above guide,
this is due to the too short aggregation interval.

100ms/2s intervals: Starts Showing Small Hot Regions
----------------------------------------------------

Following the guide, I increased the interval 20 times (100 milliseocnds and 2
seconds for sampling and aggregation intervals, respectively).

DAMON found two distinct 4 KiB regions that pretty hot.  The regions are also
well aged.  The hottest 4 KiB region was keeping the access frequency for about
8 minutes, and the coldest region was keeping no access for about 7 minutes.
The distribution on the histogram also looks like having a pattern.

Especially, the finding of the 4 KiB regions shows DAMON's adaptive regions
adjustment is working as designed.

Still the number of regions is close to the `min_nr_regions`, and sizes of cold
regions are similar, though.  Apparently it is improved, but it still has rooms
to improve.

400ms/8s intervals: Pretty Improved Results
-------------------------------------------

I further increased the intervals four times (400 milliseconds and 8 seconds
for sampling and aggregation intervals, respectively).

The number of regions having different access patterns has significantly
increased.  Size of each region is also more varied.  Total size of non-zero
access frequency regions is also significantly increased.  Maybe this is
already good enough to make some meaningful memory management efficieny
changes.

800ms/16s intervals: Another bias
---------------------------------

Further doubling the intervals (800 milliseconds and 16 seconds for sampling
and aggregation intervals, respectively) mor improved the hot regions
detection, but starts looking degrading cold regions detection.

It found more non-zero access frequency regions.  The number of regions is
still much higher than the `min_nr_regions`, but it is reduced from that of the
previous setup.  And apparently the distribution seems bit biased to hot
regions.

Conclusion
----------

Because the workload is live, the above results are not always consistent.
But, the tendency of the quality for the interval changes was consistent.

With the above experimental tuning results, I conclude the theory and the guide
makes sense to at least this workload, and could be applied to similar cases.

This also gives us an idea for automated tuning of the intervals.  If the
interval is too short, results are biased to cold regions.  If the interval is
too long, results are biased to hot regions.  Maybe DAMON can moitor to which
direction the current snapshot is biased, and adjust the intervals.  I will
develop the idea more.


Thanks,
SJ

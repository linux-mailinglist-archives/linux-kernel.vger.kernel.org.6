Having been through the code I don't think you can handle the case of a
partially covered PMD? That was never important before because by definition we
only cared about PMD-sized chunks, but it would be good to be able to collapse
to appropriately sized mTHP, memory within a VMA that doesn't cover an entire
PMD. Do you have plans to add that? Is the approach you've taken amenable to
extension in this way?

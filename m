Ah, I wasn't aware of the existing names, so that's fine if it is what
the networking world is used to.

Which reminds me, why aren't you asking for their review here as well to
ensure that you are doing things with netlink correctly?

It needs to be somewhere, otherwise we don't know how any of this is
being used at all.  And there was some binder "test code" somewhere, is
this new functionality added to that also?

Then you need to document that somewhere.

Yes, the name needs to change if you can both enable and disable reports
from it.

So userspace will now get all reports and has to do the parsing to
determine what is, and is not, relevant for what they want?  That feels
like a big security hole to me, has this been audited by the Android
security team yet?

Again, think of security issues please.  Do you want all binder
processes in a system to be able to see all other messages?

That's great, thanks.

That's what I was assuming since the TCG is currently deferring to IMA
in that regard.

That's only because IMA doesn't yet have such an event.  If we're
assuming effectively designing an IMA log format for non repudiation of
external events, one can be added.  Although I wouldn't want to be
hasty: one of the big problems of all options is that no existing log
format really covers the measure container use case and we're not
completely sure what other use cases will arise (the firewall rules
measurements was one that regulated cloud providers seem to think would
be important ... and that has a periodic rush of events, but there will
be others).

However, the current IMA templates (event descriptions) are known by an
ASCII prefix (they all begin ima-):

https://docs.kernel.org/security/IMA-templates.html#supported-template-fields-and-descriptors

So it would be easy to add more with a non ima- prefix.  Note that this
doc is out of date an IMA does support hashes all the way to SHA256
although SHA384 isn't currently listed.

The current record fields are defined in

security/integrity/ima/ima_template.c

Possibly.  Although avoiding double hashing may be a useful performance
measure (not really sure how fast records will come in yet).

Out of pure curiosity (and to make sure I fully grasp the problem at
hand), is this the capacity-based zswap writeback (i.e the one
triggered by limits), or the memory pressure based dynamic shrinker?

If you disable the latter and only rely on the former, it should not
"write pages aggressively". Limits are rarely reached (IIUC, zswap.max
are frequently used as binary knobs, and global limits are hard to
reach), so usually pages that are going to disk swap are just pages
zswap reject (i.e mostly just pages that fail to compress). This
should be a very small category. You will still see "swap" usage due
to a quirk in zswap architecture (which I'm working to fix), but there
should rarely be any IOs. So the setup itself is not super necessary.

If it's the latter then yeah I can kinda see the need for the setup.

I think it's a tad different. In the case of the commit e39925734909,
the hierarchical behavior of zswap.writeback knob is quite
semantically confusing, almost counter-intuitive (and does not conform
to the convention of other cgroup knobs, which use the most
restrictive limit - check out zswap.max limit checking for example).
That commit arguably fixes it for the "common" case (i.e you want the
hierarchical enforcement to hold for the most part). That's why there
were even conversations about cc-ing the stable mailing list for
backporting it to older kernels.

This is more of a "new use case" patch. It complicates the API, for
something readily doable in userspace - the kernel does not do
anything that userspace cannot achieve. So it should undergo stricter
scrutiny. :)

Anyway, Yosry, Johannes, how do you feel about this?

The good path now looks like the best bet to me.
The PON fallbacks are still questionable IMO.
Deselect, if taking the spec seriously, cannot really give a hint to FTL.
While daisy-chaining MMC and SD is rather rare these days, that's still the
behavior vendors implement AFAIK.
Sleep with it's vendor-defined timeouts can be anything, so this could even
trigger a cache flush internally, after we avoided sending one because of
undervoltage.
If we were to rely on actually getting 100ms heads-up we could check that
against the timeout reported by the card, but IME those are wild guesses
rather than measured values.

I don't know about safe state before power loss, it's getting it in a
state where we can execute the below.

No need to resend anything at this point, I'm curious what others have
to say on the series.

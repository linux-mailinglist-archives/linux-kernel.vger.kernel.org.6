Ok so I went looking around for the glibc patchset. It seems they're
moving away from tunables and there was a nice
GNU_PROPERTY_MEMORY_SEAL added to binutils.
So my proposal is to parse this property on the binfmt_elf.c side, and
mm would use this to know if we should seal these mappings. This seems
to tackle compatibility problems,
and glibc isn't sealing programs without this program header anyway. Though=
ts?

sysctl is also an option but the idea of dropping a random feature
behind a CONFIG_ that's unusable by lots of people (including the
general GNU/Linux ecosystem) is really really unappealing to me.

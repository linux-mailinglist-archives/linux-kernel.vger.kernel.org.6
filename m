Hi Michal, Johannes, and Shakeel,

Thank you all for taking the time to review my patch.

I was writing my response when Shakeel responded, and I think it includes
an important point. I am sending out this message in the hopes that I can
gather insight on what direction would make most sense for everyone.

Michal -- You brought up several points in your response, so I'll do my
best to answer them below.

1. Why is the lack of tracking hugeTLB problematic?

The biggest problem that I see is that if CGRP_ROOT_MEMORY_HUGETLB_ACCOUNTI=
NG
is enabled, then there is a discrepancy between what is reported in
memory.stat and memory.current, as Johannes explained in his response above=
.

As Shakeel expanded as well, it is just convenient to have the value
explicitly there, so users don't have to go through and remember where
hugeTLB pages might be used and where they might not be used.

Aside from consistency between the two files, we can see benefits in
observability. There are many reasons userspace might be intersted in
understanding the hugeTLB footprint of cgroups. To name a few, system
administrators might want to verify that hugeTLB usage is distributed as
expected across tasks: i.e. memory-intensive tasks are using more hugeTLB
pages than tasks that don't consume a lot of memory, or is seen to fault
frequently. Note that this is separate from wanting to inspect the
distribution for limiting purposes (in that case, it makes sense to use
the controller)

2. Why can't you enable the hugeTLB controller, if tracking is so important=
?

By turning on the hugeTLB controller, we gain all of the observability
that I mentioned above; users can just check the respective hugetlb files.
However, the discrepancy between memory.stat and memory.current is still
there. When I check memory.current, I expect to be able to explain the usag=
e
by looking at memory.stat and trying to understand the breakdown, not by go=
ing
into the various hugetlb controller files to check how/if the memory is
accounted for.

But even if we are okay with this, I think it might be overkill to
enable the hugeTLB controller for the convenience of being able to inspect
the hugeTLB usage for cgroups. This is especially true in workloads where
we can predict what usage patterns will be like, and we do not need to enfo=
rce
specific limits on hugeTLB usage.

3. What if CGRP_ROOT_MEMORY_HUGETLB_ACCOUNTING is disabled?

This is a great point. The way the patch is currently implemented, it
should still do the accounting to memory.stat, even if
CGRP_ROOT_MEMORY_HUGETLB_ACCOUNTING is disabled. This would give us the rev=
erse
problem where hugeTLB usage that is reported in the statistics are no longe=
r
accounted for in current...

I think it makes sense to show hugeTLB statistics in memory.stat only if
hugeTLB is accounted for in memory.current as well (i.e. check if
CGRP_ROOT_MEMORY_HUGETLB_ACCOUNTING is enabled before doing the accounting,
or move the accounting from hugeTLB alloc/free --> hugeTLB charge/uncharge,
which should only happen if hugeTLBs are accounted for in memory.current).

What do you think?

Joshua

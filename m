No. You cannot simply add a signed-off-by on someone else's behalf,
even if you cc the person.

Andreas contributed code to GRUB (which is a GPLv3 project), and had
no involvement whatsoever in creating this patch.

A signed-off-by is a statement on the part of the contributor (which
may or may not be the author) that the contribution in question
complies with the requirements imposed by the project in terms of
copyright and licensing. Linux is GPLv2 not v3, so this code should at
least be dual licensed in order to be reused directly.

I did not look at the GRUB patch, and IANAL, but this code invokes an
Apple provided protocol (which is proprietary) in a hardcoded way for
interoperability purposes, and so there is not much to
copyright/license anyway. I would be fine with having just your
signoff on this patch, but you could ask Andreas for a GPLv2+3 version
of his GRUB patch if you are not sure.

Agree that this is suboptimal. If we need a command line param for
this, please make add it to the efi= list

This should be unsigned long

... to match the mixed_mode overlay which is u32. Alternatively, they
could both be u64 but the current arrangement is definitely incorrect.

I don't think that is necessary. If the mixed_mode overlay is never
used, it doesn't really matter and you can use unsigned long vs u32,
in which case all struct members are native word size so there is no
padding issue.

This is how the x86 plumbing works for mixed mode. Every EFI protocol
is a union, with a mixed_mode member describing the 32-bit view. The
accessor macros (efi_bs_call, efi_table_attr) automatically do the
right thing depending on the bitness of the firmware.

This means, though, that even protocols that are known not to exist on
32-bit firmware need to be implemented in the same way, or the code
will not build.

I don't remember the details but it looks like we stopped doing this a
while ago. I don't mind keeping it like this.

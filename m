Yeah. Though I am not an experienced file system developer, I was thinking
the philosophy behind the data=3Djournal design sometimes.

In essence, unlike the metadata, the user data could be dirtied in an unexp=
ected
and uncontrollable way.

For example, calls like __block_write_begin() is a function that could dirt=
y
the user data, but __block_write_begin() is beyond ext4 maintainer's contro=
l.
We cannot tell the block layer maintainer, =E2=80=98Hey, we want to trace t=
he dirty user
data in ext4, can we add some special code for ext4 in __block_write_begin?=
=E2=80=99:P

Whilst for metadata, each time the dirting of each piece of metadata is man=
aged
by ext4's internal code logic.

The uncontrollable dirting of user data is the root cause of all problems.

That's quite a long time. Jan, you are a great developer. Cheers for you.:P

Yeah, Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on something truly
meaningful. All I can do until now is some small cleanups. And doing cleanu=
ps
all the time is annoyable to the maintainers and frustrating to me. I
will try my best.

So basically, we should:
1.Trace the user data dirting in ext4_block_write_begin().
2.Replace the uncontrollable __block_write_begin with ext4_block_write_begi=
n().
3.Remove some superfluous things.

Cheers,
Stephen.

This patch series consist of six parts and covers the following:

1. Re-enable context caching for Qualcomm SoCs to retain prefetcher
   settings during reset and runtime suspend.

2. Remove cfg inside qcom_smmu structure and replace it with single
   pointer to qcom_smmu_match_data avoiding replication of multiple
   members from same.

3. Add support for ACTLR PRR bit setup via adreno-smmu-priv interface.

4. Introduce intital set of driver changes to implement ACTLR register
   for custom prefetcher settings in Qualcomm SoCs.

5. Add ACTLR data and support for qcom_smmu_500.

Changes in v16 from v15:
 - Incorporate Dimitry's suggestion on patch 4/5 to use dev_dbg instead of dev_notice.
 - Fix kernel test robot warning [1] coming for 32bit architecture configuration.
 - Updatingthe tags

 Link to v15:
 https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240920155813.3434021-1-quic_bibekkum@quicinc.com/

Changes in v15 from v14:
 - As discussed with Robin and Dmitry modify the actlr table and logic to use
   compatible string instead of sid, mask for device matching which is
   similar to qcom_smmu_client_of_match mechanism.
 - Expand the comment in qcom_smmu500_reset to document reason why CPRE bit is re-enabled again
   after arm_mmu500_reset resets the bit.
 - Rearrange the series in order to keep prefetch setting patches in the end.

 https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240816174259.2056829-1-quic_bibekkum@quicinc.com/

Changes in v14 from v13:
 Patch 6/6:
 - As discussed incorprate changes to carry out PRR implementation only for
   targets based on MMU-500 by using compat string based SMMU version detection.
 - Split the set_actlr interface into two separate interface namely set_prr_bit
   and set_prr_addr to set the prr enable bit and prr page address resepectively.
 Patch 3/6:
  - Fix a bug in gfx actlr_config which is uncovered while testing the gfx actlr setting in sc7280
    during PRR experiment which prevented clients on certain sids of gfx smmmu to be skipped during
    setting up of the ACTLR values : Fix involves swapping the arguments passed in smr_is_subset to make
     device smr <from devicetree> a subset of actlr_config table entries < defined in the driver>.
 Patch 4/6, 5/6:
  - Sort the actlr table values in increasing order of the SIDs.

   same to traverse the table and save on sentinel space along with
   indentation levels.
 - Refactor blocks containing qcom_smmu_set_actlr to remove block
   repetition in patch 3/5.
 - Change copyright year from 2023 to 2022-2023 in patch 3/5.

Changes in v7 from v6:
 Changes to incorporate suggestions from Dmitry as follows:
 - Use io_start address instead of compatible string to identify the
   correct instance by comparing with smmu start address and check for
   which smmu the corresponding actlr table is to be picked.
Link to v6:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231220133808.5654-1-quic_bibekkum@quicinc.com/

 - Modify the defines for prefetch in (foo << bar) format
   as suggested.(FIELD_PREP could not be used in defines
   is not inside any block/function)

 - Shift context caching enablement patch as 1/5 instead of 5/5 to
   be picked up as independent patch.
 - Fix the codestyle to orient variables in reverse xmas tree format
   for patch 1/5.

 Link to v4:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20231215101827.30549-1-quic_bibekkum@quicinc.com/

Changes in v4 from v3:
 New addition:
 - Remove actlrcfg_size and use NULL end element instead to traverse
   the actlr table, as this would be a cleaner approach by removing
   redundancy of actlrcfg_size.
 - Renaming of actlr set function to arm_smmu_qcom based proprietary
   convention.
 - break from loop once sid is found and ACTLR value is initialized
   in qcom_smmu_set_actlr.

 - Modify comments for prefetch defines as per SMMU-500 TRM.
 Changes to incorporate suggestions from Konrad as follows:
 - Use Reverse-Christmas-tree sorting wherever applicable.

   duplicate variables.
 - Use array indexing instead of direct pointer addressed by new
   addition of eliminating actlrcfg_size.
 - Switch the HEX value's case from upper to lower case in SC7280
   actlrcfg table.
 Changes to incorporate suggestions from Dmitry as follows:
 - Separate changes not related to ACTLR support to different commit
   with patch 5/5.
 - Using pointer to struct for arguments in smr_is_subset().
 Changes to incorporate suggestions from Bjorn as follows:
 - fix the commit message for patch 2/5 to properly document the
   value space to avoid confusion.

 New addition:
 - Include patch 3/4 for adding ACTLR support and data for SC7280.
 - Add driver changes for actlr support in gpu smmu.
 - Add target wise actlr data and implementation ops for gpu smmu.
 Changes to incorporate suggestions from Robin as follows:
 - Match the ACTLR values with individual corresponding SID instead
   of assuming that any SMR will be programmed to match a superset of
   the data.
 - Instead of replicating each elements from qcom_smmu_match_data to
   qcom_smmu structre during smmu device creation, replace the
   replicated members with qcom_smmu_match_data structure inside
   qcom_smmu structre and handle the dereference in places that
   requires them.
 Changes to incorporate suggestions from Dmitry and Konrad as follows:
 - Maintain actlr table inside a single structure instead of
   nested structure.
 - Rename prefetch defines to more appropriately describe their
   behavior.

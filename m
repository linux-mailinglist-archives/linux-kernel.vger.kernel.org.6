Yes correct, those are in SMMU global space which hyp likes to own, and
read/write access are avaialble by design for EL1.

Right, if the page is dynamically allocated then this reserved memory 
node should be removed as it will stay as an unused region in DDR acting 
as a deadweight. I checked the history on this region for x1e80100 and 
it went as a part of platform upstreaming - we can remove the same.

Agree on the concern, that would surely look a bit ugly - with different 
targets having these allocation differently and having this 
reserved-memory node

But as far as I checked the targets present with MMU-500, none of them 
is relying on reserved-memory node yet.
And the chances are negligible in future targets as well.
Since FW is not setting up these registers - so this reserved region
should not be considered as per me.
Also since in our api we are only taking the address of the prr page to 
setup these registers, so even if client chooses any page allocation 
method <not surely from firmware as per design> then the same api 
smmu-driver is exposing would still work indentical.

Yes right, atleast one thing which we can conclude is - in
MMU-500 version the PRR enablement steps are same from SMMU block and
driver perspective <i.e configure the PRR_CFG_*ADDR regs and set PRR bit
in ACTLR>. So all targets on MMU-500 - we would do the same steps.
Hence under MMU-500 compat string we can keep this.
Agree on the smmu-v2 part as well.

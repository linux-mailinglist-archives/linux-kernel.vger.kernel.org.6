Whatever you work out here with Qualcomm, I can at least test this on this
board:

    https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.9-rc3/source/arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sa8775p-ride.dts#L266

So basically the same SoC as the one Sneh is adding some support for
here, but on a board with a Marvell 88EA1512 connected via SGMII stuck in
a remote lab somewhere.

I don't have documentation on the IP though... but can at least provide
some testing. Qualcomm has access (I think) to two other boards with the
same SoC, one with some Aquantia phy (that I think is 2500 Mbps
capable), and another with a fixed-link setup at 2500 Mbps. If I
understand correctly the latter works with the driver already.

Please CC me on future patches on the topic and I'll at least give them
a spin and a look, following through some of your threads today this is a
real rats nest.

Thanks,
Andrew

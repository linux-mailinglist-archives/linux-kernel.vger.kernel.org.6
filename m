So I'll try to describe in the following how the SCMI stack is
designed and behaves as it stands now....probably not exactly in a
concise way ... :P

The protocol-nodes in the DT are used to describe the presence and
sometime additional properties of an SCMI Protocol like Clock,
Peformance, Pinctrl etc, beside being used in phandles to refer to
specific per-protocol resources from other drivers.
(arch/arm64/boot/dts/arm/juno-scmi.dtsi to see how protocol nodes
 are referred )

Note also that the SCNI protocol is extensible and growing, we have 10
stanard protocols currently and potentially a number of additional vendor
protocols numbers that can be defined in the future.

The core SCMI stack knows how to build,send and track the proper SCMI
messages for all of these SCMI protocols and their well defined SCMI
commands, and exposes a common API (include/linux/scmi_protocol.h) in the
classic "file-operations" style for the driver-users that wants to use
such SCMI facilities.

As an example, clk-scmi is one of this SCMI drivers: it plugs on one side
on the standard CLK frameowrk and then registers also as an SCMI driver
with the SCMI stack, so that it can access and use the related specific
scmi_clk_ops to map common operations like clocks enable/disable into an
SCMI message exchange.

When the SCMI core stack comes up it queries the SCMI/fw upfront via the
dedicated Base protocol to discover, amongst other stuff, the list of
supported protocols by the current platorm.

An SCMI driver like clk-scmi needs some sort of device to drive: the
driver itself declares the protocol(CLK) that he wants to use and a name,
and the SCMI bus will create a device accordingly, using the related
protocol device_node and the name choosen (so that multiple devices
can exist with different names for different drivers but using the same
protocol)

Then, the clk-scmi driver at probe time, after a successufl match on
protocol/name, will obtain the related clk_scmi ops from the core
stack together with an opaque handle for that instance of the SCMI
stack: this first SCMI/clk user will trigger the specific core protocol
initialization code to be run.

The clk-scmi driver can then issue any CLK related ops he wants
during its lifetime.

Protocols are initialized on first use: when a SCMI driver appears that
wants to use protocol-X ops, protocol-X will be initialized...any
subsequent driver appearing that wants to use protocol-X will use the
same initialized protocol stack.

...BUT you can have possibly multiple drivers willing to use the same
protocol, probably on a disjoint set of resources in that protocol:
an example of this is the Sensor protocol which is used by scmi-hwmon
for a few classic sensors, BUT also by scmi-iio for another class of
distinct sensors (and plugging into a different subsystem): such drivers
will both use Sensor protocol and both will have a device created an
"hwmon"/sensor vs "iio"/sensor...

...the problem is, as it start to become apparent, I have ONLY one single
DT node to represent the protocol which I can use to embed in the
created devices...

In this scenario I would like to have multiple distinct DT nodes describing
the same protocol so that I can instantiate different devices using the same
protocol but using a distinct device_node...just I am not sure how to create
such a duplicate node out of thin-air in a non-dirty way...moreover I am not
even sure this is doable, since I fear that such a solution will even more
break the stack, since how the phandle references across the DT are even
supposed to work if I magically create a duplicate of a device_node
urelated to any real DT...

...sorry for my ignorance in this area, any advice will be very much welcome.

Thanks,
Cristian

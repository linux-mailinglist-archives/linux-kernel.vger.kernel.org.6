So, with a base DT having:
  /export/ label0: node@0 {
  }

  /export/ label1: node@1 {
  }

the __symbols__ node will contains:
  __symbols__ {
	label0 = ...;
	label1 = ...;
  }

without export-symbols, the overlay will look like this:
  connector: __overlay__ {
	...
	ref = <&connector>;
  }

The "connector" label is the only one we can use from the overlay to
reference the base DT (special label defined on the __overlay__ node).
As it is defined to point to __overlay__, it has to be resolved to the
exported symbol that point to the node where the overlay is applied.

If the overlay is applied on node@0, 'connector' is resolved to node@0.

This case cannot be handled:
   connector: __overlay__ {
	...
	ref1 = <&connector>;
        ref2 = <&other-label-from-base-dt>;
   }

Indeed, only one 'connector' label can be resolved to node@0 or node@1.
other-label-from-base-dt cannot be resolved based on the node the overlay
is applied to.

Again, I am not sure on my side that we have to handle this case of multiple
labels in the overlay that point to the base DT dependent on node@0 or node@1.

On my use case, I considered the node@0 or node@1 as nexus nodes and so, all
GPIOs (soon PWM, I hope, and probably other ressources in the future) can be
referenced using nexus nodes.

If pinctrl can be handled using nexus node, it should be ok. Otherwise
things are going to be complicated. Again, with your proposal, we can
reference only one label from the overlay, the node where the overlay
is applied to.

compatible property will not be enough. We can have two exact same
connectors on the same base board:
  /export/ label0: node@0 {
     compatible = 'foo,addon-connector';
  }

  /export/ label1: node@1 {
     compatible = 'foo,addon-connector';
  }

To load the overlay, we can match compatible for sure but we need to node
the overlay is supposed to be applied to.

Also, it you want to check bindings for node@0 available in the base DT
and bindings in the overlay, having one compatible string with different
meaning will introduce some complexity.
A compatible string can now define the "provider" part (the base DT) and
the "consumer" part (the overlay).

Well, my proposal was to give enough information to the resolver instead of
handling errors.

I probably miss something but I don't see what could be the benefit to do
that in the other way. Can you give me more details about your idea?

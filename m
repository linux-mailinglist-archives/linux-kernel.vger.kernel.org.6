Thanks for building all these tables -- I want to look at it all again
myself, but I'm pretty well convinced you've found a bunch of things we
need to sort out.

I am okay with counted_by winning out over alloc_size when it is present.
However, I would expect this:

void *v = malloc(1024);
struct flex *p = v;
p->counter = 4;

__bdos(p, 1) == struct_size(f, array, 4)	// "p" has both size hints
__bdos(v, 1) == 1024				// "v" only has alloc_size

I think gcc refuses to believe "p" is anything until it has been
dereferenced to a specific type. I would like it if they could fix this,
as if we have a pointer to a type and we're using __bdos to query its
size, we are explicitly treating it as the type it is pointing at (i.e.
examining the counter and evaluating the FAM size).

This is making my head spin. In a practical sense, a struct instance
has a fixed size (which I would say is the calculation using max(),
above). Whether the . or -> operators are used shouldn't matter (to
the program's view of the object size).

This "1 becomes 5" should just not be allowed. I can accept object padding
contributing to object size, but we should not redefine the array size
out from under what it actually is. I don't want array accesses into
padding either. :P

I think 36 is correct here, not 40 nor 43.

For type 1, I agree: this needs to be the precise size of the array.

As of now, are GCC and Clang both using:

max(sizeof(*p),
    offsetof(typeof(*p), FAM) + count * sizeof(*p->FAM))

?

Linux can adjust struct_size() to match, and I'll check that nothing
shrunk inappropriately...

Thanks, but I do blame myself a bit for not doing it earlier. :)

Yes, we've touched quite a few areas, for some of which I've already
started working on the associated patches.  That was one of the reasons
for the delays.

Of course, but I might actually have some comments and suggestions
for some of the patches, and addressing those suggestions, if we end up
agreeing on them, would be a bit messy if some of the patches in the
series become merged first.

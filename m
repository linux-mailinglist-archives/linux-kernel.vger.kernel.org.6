Right, and if we can rule out any users that are supposed to work after 
fork(), we can just disregard that in the first version.

I never played with this, but let's assume you make use of these 
mm-local allocations in KVM context.

What would happens if you fork() with a KVM fd and try accessing that fd 
from the other process using ioctls? I recall that KVM will not be 
"duplicated".

What would happen if you send that fd over to a completely different 
process and try accessing that fd from the other process using ioctls?

Of course, question being: if you have MM-local allocations in both 
cases and there is suddenly a different MM ... assuming that both cases 
are even possible (if they are not possible, great! :) ).

I think I am supposed to know if these things are possible or not and 
what would happen, but it's late Friday and my brain is begging for some 
Weekend :D

If an allocation is MM-local, I would assume that fork() would 
*duplicate* that allocation (leaving CoW out of the picture :D ), but 
that's where the fun begins (see above regarding my confusion about KVM 
and fork() behavior ... ).

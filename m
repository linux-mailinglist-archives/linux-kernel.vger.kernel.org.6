Hi Emil, thanks for taking time to review!

Added CC: Minda Chen, Hal Feng

Please Minda and Hal can you follow-up on Emil's comments as well?

Yes, I agree, and Linux is not the only consumer of devicetree. I would 
like USB function to work for users of Linux and U-Boot on these boards 
by copying what the vendor Board Support Package does what is shipped 
with the products. If it is more in-depth than this I will defer to Hal 
or Minda.


For some wider context, upstream U-Boot is about to adopt the 
dt-rebasing via Hal's OF_UPSTREAM for JH7110 boards series and then also 
there is a patch set from Minda Chen to add the on-chip JH7110 USB 
support to U-Boot, and so then and there it will depend on these dts 
changes. If you have Milk-V Mars then already there are three of four 
USB-A receptacle ports which are functional on PCIe-connected VL805 USB 
chipset.

USB-C port on Mars is not wired for data here, that is only true for 
VisionFive2. If the user wants to use their USB-A receptacle as OTG port 
I will not object to a future improvement, but here we want the basic 
expectations of users covered that they should have four working USB-A 
receptacle ports in U-Boot (and possibly in Linux, depending on the 
overcurrent register wherever it is set). This is what I am meaning, 
there may be somebody using a male-male USB-A USB-A cable for OTG but 
more likely is that people just want to plug in USB peripherals to host 
ports and use their mouse / keyboard / flash memory, I think.


There is no USB-C port on Star64.

Sure, can I try to explain this more.

Yes, and since Linux doesn't have kernel execute-only memory (and likely
won't for some time), it doesn't make sense to use FineIBT over KCFI for
that reason.

Hm? KCFI does too. IBT is still enabled with KCFI (when the hardware
supports it).

KCFI doesn't need LTO either.

What? Measured how? I feel like you're thinking about the old Clang CFI,
not the modern KCFI implementation.

To bypass KCFI, the attacker additionally needs a targeted memory
exposure to get the correct function hash that they must include before
the malicious function they construct. With FineIBT, no such exposure is
needed.

I mean, a whitepaper's threat model is nice and all, but this just isn't
the reality. Linux certainly tries to maintain W^X, but there are bugs
and things like BPF, which can be manipulated to gain attacker-controlled
executable code injected into the kernel address space. (e.g. BPF will
flip a writable region from RW to RX, so W^X is maintained spatially but
not temporally.)

So without execute-only memory, some deployments prefer to not weaken
the CFI implementation to allow for hash checking bypasses. Once X-O
exists, FineIBT is a slam-dunk over KCFI. :)

I believe (Miguel was talking about this at one of the conferences,
maybe he'll chime in) that there was work in progress to solidify the
aliasing and ownership rules at the unsafe level, but it sounded like it
may have still been an area of research.

If that work is successful it could lead to significant improvements in
code generation, since aliasing causes a lot of unnecessary spills and
reloads - VLIW could finally become practical.

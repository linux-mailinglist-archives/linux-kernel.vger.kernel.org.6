Of the still-open errata, #562869 could be safely mitigated by nobbling 
ARM_SMMU_FEAT_FMT_AARCH32_S, but #1047329 is the one which worries me, 
since even if we don't support nesting within Linux, I'm wary of the 
firmware hypervisor sticking its own S2 under any S1 context we set up. 
I guess we could try the alternate SMMU_ACR.IPA2PA_CEN workaround for 
that, however it's not obvious that the performance impact in that case 
wouldn't be worse than whatever benefit may be gained from keeping CPRE.

Thanks,
Robin.

Do you mean the below example? The status bit (32) of the fixed counter
0 is always set.


65.147782: x86_perf_event_set_period: idx:    32 period:         1 left:  2
65.147783: intel_pmu_handle_irq:      loops: 001 status: 100000000

65.147784: x86_perf_event_set_period: idx:    32 period:         1 left:  2

I think it's up to 32, not always 32.
I don't have more details regarding the issue. The architect of HSW has
left. I'm asking around internally to find the original bug report of
the erratum. Hope there are more details in the report.

Appreciate it.

Great. I will post a patch to improve it.

Got it.

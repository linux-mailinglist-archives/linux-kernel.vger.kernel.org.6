It may brings some compatible issue for the old platforms. There may be
two ways to address it.
- Add a symlink or something to link the "power" and "power_pkg".
- Only when there are two or more different scopes of counters in a
system, the "power_<scope>" are used. If there is only one scope of
power counter, "power" is still used.
The latter method is used for the Intel uncore and hybrid core drivers now.

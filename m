It is hard to call it is a bug in anything. The Linux patch is reasonable
in honouring the CPU topology. The hypervisor is reasonable to exposing
sockets=N,cores=1 as there's no right answer for the topology choice, and
it has no idea how it may or may not impact guest OS behaviour or perf.
Letting CPUs float freely is sensible default behaviour too. All of them
conspire to have a perf impact here, but the deployment is not seeking
to maximise performance, rather to maximise flexibility & density.

None the less, I'd suggest that virt-manager should be a explicitly
asking for sockets=1,cores=N, as that has broader guest OS compatibility.
By chance that would also help this scenario, but that woudn't be a
driving factor as we can't pick defaults based on the needs of particular
versions of a particular guest kernel.

With regards,
Daniel

I guess he meant it's only for Topdown metric groups with an incorrect
order on those models.

I see.  So are you proposing this?

Dapeng and Kan, can you verify if it's ok?  My quick tests look ok.

Sorry, I think I didn't follow the previous thread and missed your
feedback.

Yeah I understand your point and it sounds reasonable.  Thanks for your
feedback.  I don't think I'll revert the change though, we can add the
fix on top instead.

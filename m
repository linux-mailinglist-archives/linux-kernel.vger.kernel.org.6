Good point, that would only happen if a caller, say, maps 2MB + 1MB + 
1MB then does a combined unmap of 4MB, which *could* technically happen 
even in the DMA API, via one of the iommu_map_sg() paths, but in 
practice I'd agree it's unlikely enough to not be worth worrying about 
optimising for. Thus we could potentially even get away with doing this 
more like __arm_lpae_map(), i.e. just find and take out any non-leaf 
entries first, then blat the full range to take care of any remaining 
leaves.

> Shall I send a new version with this update?

Sure, if you're happy to have a play around to see what works out 
cleanest, I'd certainly be interested to see the result (no rush on my 
behalf though, I'm about to take a couple of weeks off so won't be 
looking at much until rc1 now anyway.)

Cheers,
Robin.

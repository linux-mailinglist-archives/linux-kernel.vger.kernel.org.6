It is more about, what does phy-mode = "rgmii"; mean? It means the
board provides the delay via extra long clock lines. Except for when
some random MAC driver has a completely different meaning, it is not
documented it means something else, you have to read the sources and
the mailing lists, to find out what this particularly MAC driver is
doing for phy-mode = "rgmii".

Do we really want that. Or should we define that phy-mode = "rgmii"
means the PCB provides the delay. End of story, no exceptions. And
that "rgmii-id" means the MAC/PHY pair need to provide the delay? End
of story, no exceptions.

It has to be that why. If the MAC does the delay, the MAC needs to
ensure the PHY does not do the delays and well, and it achieves that
by setting PHY_INTERFACE_MODE to indicate the PHY should not add
delays. Do you have a better idea how this can be done?

We have tried to improve the documentation. We have also been very
rigid in reviewing DT bindings, and what these things mean. But it
seems like many developers don't read reviews other developers get. Go
search the email archive. How many times have i had this very same
conversation?

Everybody gets pause wrong. Everybody gets EEE wrong. Everybody gets
RGMII delays wrong, not matter how many times we tell developers they
are getting it wrong.... phylink is helping with this, it takes it out
of developers hands so they cannot get pause or soon EEE wrong.

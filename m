Hi Johan,

so the SCMI stack is fully modularizable as of this release, i.e.

 - SCMI core (scmi-core + scmi-module)
 - SCMI transports (scmi_transport_{mailbox,virtio,smc,optee}
 - optional SCMI Vendor protos
 - Std and Vendor SCMI Drivers on top of protos

....on the other side the SCMI standard protocols are still embedded
in scmi-module (or builtin) as of now...

Even though, module usage is tracked by the core AND when an SCMI Vendor
driver tries to use protocol_X, it causes protocol_X to be initialized
(calling its protocol_init), there is NO auto-loading for SCMI Vendor
Protocols when bult as LKM...because there were really no ask till now
and this stuff is in general needed so very early dburing boot...so the
usecase of all these LKM modules is just debug/test as in your case
(or in mine frequently)....

...and I am NOT saying with this that is necessarily right or must be
stay like this...just explaining how it is now....

....anyway...it is mostly trivial to add vendor/protocols autoloading
transparently...today I was experimenting with a patch that triggers
autoloading based on a generic common alias pattern in the form
'scmi-protocol-0x<NN>' (with NN the specific protocol ID of course)
that triggers the loading as soon as the SCMI Vendor driver tries to
access the protocol during its probe...

....I will post it for the next cycle once it is clean.
(unless I am missing something else that you want to add...)

This seems like FW rejecting the command, maybe just only for the specific
Linux OSPM agent since it is not allowed to ask for that specific setup,
and only Sibi can shed a light here :D

...but this Vendor protocol, if I am not mistaken, AFAIU, uses a bunch
of "algo strings" coming from tokens it picks from DT and use thsoe as
params for the set_param() VendorProtocol ops...cannot be that a bad/missing
DT value could cause the FW to reject the command due to the params ?
(even if the command is supported)...

...just a guess ah... I have no real knowledge of this venndor proto...


Thanks,
Cristian

What do you mean by "top level knob"? I assume
/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled ?

If so, that's not really a thing in its own right; its just the legacy PMD-size
THP control, and we only take any notice of it if a per-size control is set to
"inherit". So if we have:

# echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/hugepages-2048kB/enabled

Then by design, /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled should be ignored.

Well that's the design and that's how its documented. It's done this way for
back-compat. All controls are now per-size. But at boot, we default all per-size
controls to "never" except for the PMD-sized control, which is defaulted to
"inherit". That way, an unenlightened user-space can still control PMD-sized THP
via the legacy (top-level) control. But enlightened apps can directly control
per-size.

I'm not sure how your way would work, because you would have 2 controls
competing to do the same thing?

Process is different between host and guest in arch/arm64, arch_get_random_seed_longs.
(1) In host , smccc_trng_available is false, it get randomness from RNDRRS.

(2) In guest, smccc_trng_available is true, because kvm emulate it. Guest use smccc trng
and hvc, and trap to host kvm. Then in host call stack:
kvm_smccc_call_handler
kvm_trng_call
kvm_trng_do_rnd
get_random_long
...
arch_get_random_seed_longs

host get randomness as (1) and return random u64 to guest.
So the randomness guest finally get is from RNDRRS too.
Can we let guest get randomness directly from RNDRRS, not using hvc first?
The process for guest like (1):
1) kvm not emulated smccc trng for guest
2) guest check smccc trng, and get smccc_trng_available=false
3) guest get randomness from RNDRRS

Thanks.

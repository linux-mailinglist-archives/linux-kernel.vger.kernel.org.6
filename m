So this is now the behavior with the patch I sent.

I don't think JSON really means anything here. We use JSON as a way to
import tables of events. We want to map an event name to a config
value, we could do it in lots of different ways. There is a difference
between:
 - legacy events: hard coded event numbers for certain typically CPU
events, although there are L3 cache events in there,
 - sysfs: events advertised by the PMU driver in sysfs,
 - events built into the tool, imported from json files.

The first problem that happened was BIG.little. ARM did nothing to fix
the perf APIs for BIG.little and Intel fixed things up when they did
hybrid. What does it mean to open a legacy event on a process in a
BIG.little CPU when the process may be scheduled onto either BIG or
little cores? ARM's non-solution was that you'd profile based on which
PMU driver registered first and not profile on the other - you would
be profiling on some fraction of your CPUs but not all.

While Intel added proper hybrid/BIG.little support they did so by
essentially forking every aspect of the perf tool to have a "hybrid"
version. I put a stop to this in the metrics code and by doing so
ended up taking on responsibility for cleaning up the mess Intel had
been creating. This led to the event parser being able to parse "<PMU
name>/<legacy event name>/" for example in "cpu_core/cycles/" and
"cpu_atom/cycles/" and encode the legacy event.

This caused issues on ARM, especially Apple ones - maybe Apple should
be asked to support their PMU? Previously their PMU would advertise
events like cycles and the sysfs encoding would be used as there was
no notion of using the legacy encoding. Now the legacy encoding was
used and for some reason we don't maintain legacy mappings of events
for PMUs on Apple CPUs. After being politely shouted at, and to my
surprise Intel agreeing, we made it so sysfs or events built into the
tool take priority over legacy events if the PMU is specified. This
wasn't a small change as every test expectation needed updating for
this. We still have some broken test expectations.

So we had a case where legacy events weren't the priority if the PMU
was specified but when no PMU was specified they had priority. This
was frankly weird and so the patch you bisected to fixed this and was
also a behavior RISC-V had asked for. There was even some discussion
on this subject at LPC 2023.

Is everything fixed? Nope. It is still the case on ARM that we don't
profile on all CPUs for perf stat. This is because when no event is
specified hand crafted perf_event_attr are passed to perf_event_open
and these perf_event_attr need to open multiple for a
BIG.little/hybrid system:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/too=
ls/perf/builtin-stat.c#n1942
I wrote a fix for this:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240510053705.2462258-4-irogers@google.com/
Unreviewed/unmerged and frankly I think ARM should be in the driving
seat for reviewing it as it is trying to fix their CPUs.

So I think the parsing is now robust/consistent but that doesn't mean
the behavior matches your expectations.

I say robust as when any event, regardless of whether it happens to
alias the few hundred legacy names, will parse. Previous parsing meant
events advertised by AMD's PMU, like branch-brs, would return parse
errors as "branch" and "brs" looked like components of a legacy event
name.

Consistent in that, regardless of event name, we will try the same
process to find the event.

I don't understand why you think JSON comes into this. Is it because
I've sent patches with JSON encoding events and metrics in? In the
case of AMD's "branch-brs" and the "cycles" event, the event has been
advertised via sysfs and not from data in JSON tables.

> But whatever. With his patch, at least it works for me.

You followed up in:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=3Dwi5Ri=3DyR2jBVk-4HzTzpoAWOgstr1LEvg_-O=
XtJvXXJOA@mail.gmail.com/
with:

> So no. That still needs to be fixed, or the whole "prefer sysfs/JSON
> by default" needs to be reverted.

So I think we still need to figure out what:

$ perf <command> -e <event> ...

where <event> doesn't specify a PMU means. I'll try to enumerate the option=
s:

1) the 6.9 behavior where <event> will be searched for on every PMU
and each PMU that has that event will have it opened. This can lead to
failures depending on what <command> is going to do. If <event> is a
legacy event name then it will be opened only on core PMUs.
2) the current perf-tools branch behavior where <event> is searched
for on every PMU regardless of it being a legacy or non-legacy event
name.
3) (2) but we change drivers to not advertise events where the name
conflicts with a legacy event name.
4) if the PMU isn't specified with <event> then we only search core
PMUs (e.g. armv8_pmuv3_0, cpu, cpu_core, cpu_atom)
5) we parse all events as with (2) but depending on <command> can
choose to ignore perf_event_open failing.

I'll try to rustle up a patch for (5), I have no way to test it. I
expect it will make somebody somewhere unhappy, apologies in advance.

Thanks,
Ian

I believe that hte problem only exists on x86, becaause they use 
patchable-function-entry for their FINEIBT patching (and use -mfentry
for ftrace), whereas everyone else uses patchable-function-entry for
ftrace.

It won't adversely affect CFI, but it will open up rust code for ftrace,
so I'm not sure that "it doesn't hurt".

AFAICT at the moment this isn't necessary for CFI, so can we drop this
patch for now?

If we want to pass these flags for !x86, the justification should be to
enable ftrace for rust code, and we should test that actually works
(e.g. by testing ftrace with rust code).

What happens on x86 for ftrace and rust?

From their replies it sounds like that happens to be true in practice
today, but as above I think we should go test this actually works.

Subject: [PATCH 5/9] Docs/mm/damon/design: move 'Configurable Operations Set' section into 'Operations Set Layer' section

'Configurable Operations Set' section is for providing a description of
the pluggability of the operations set layer.  Just after that,
'Operations Set Layer' section, which is dedicated for the entire things
of the layer, follows.  The layout is odd, and some descriptions are
duplicated.  Move 'Configurable Operations Set' section into 'Operations
Set Layer' and re-write some of the detailed descriptions.

 Operations Set Layer
 ====================
 
-The monitoring operations are defined in two parts:
+.. _damon_design_configurable_operations_set:
+
+For data access monitoring and additional low level work, DAMON needs a set of
+implementations for specific operations that are dependent on and optimized for
+the given target address space.  For example, below two operations for access
+monitoring are address-space dependent.
 
 1. Identification of the monitoring target address range for the address space.
 2. Access check of specific address range in the target space.
 
+DAMON consolidates these implementations in a layer called DAMON Operations
+Set, and defines the interface between it and the upper layer.  The upper layer
+is dedicated for DAMON's core logics including the mechanism for control of the
+monitoring accruracy and the overhead.
+
+Hence, DAMON can easily be extended for any address space and/or available
+hardware features by configuring the core logic to use the appropriate
+operations set.  If there is no available operations set for a given purpose, a
+new operations set can be implemented following the interface between the
+layers.
+
+For example, physical memory, virtual memory, swap space, those for specific
+processes, NUMA nodes, files, and backing memory devices would be supportable.
+Also, if some architectures or devices support special optimized access check
+features, those will be easily configurable.
+
 DAMON currently provides below three operation sets.  Below two subsections
 describe how those work.

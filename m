That's hard to judge, unfortunately.  The only fact is that 6.11 and
6.12-rc are still buggy and fail to boot due to the kernel Oops from
Mediatek BT stuff.  The patch
  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240822052310.25220-1-hao.qin@mediatek.com/
seems working around it, but it doesn't mean that this is the right
fix, either.

My wild guess is that there are substantial problems at btmtk stuff
about the firmware management.  It blocks unbinding if something goes
wrong, and this bug surfaced casually due to another change.

Either a revert of the firmware or the patch that triggered the issue
would be helpful as a temporary workaround, yes.  We need a quick
duct-tape coverage, then fix the fundamental failure.

I can build a test kernel and ask the reporter for testing if once
something is provided, of course.  Just ping me.

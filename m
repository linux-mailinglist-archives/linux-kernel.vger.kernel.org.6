On Intel, topdown metrics are shown by default when no options are
passed to `perf stat`. This achieved by putting "Default" into the
MetricGroup. I wanted to raise this in case it was an oversight not to
add this metric to the Default metric group like
"Topdown_Backend;Default".

Alternatively you can remove the "* 100" in the MetricExpr and have
the ScaleUnit be "100percent of cycles".

It's more readable than container_of(), IMO. "give me the struct size
for variable VAR, which has a flexible array MEMBER, when we have COUNT
many of them": struct_size(VAR, MEMBER, COUNT). It's more readable, more
robust, and provides saturation in the face of potential wrap-around.

It provides annotation for the compiler to perform run-time bounds
checking on dynamically sized arrays. i.e. CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE and
CONFIG_UBSAN_BOUNDS can actually reason about annotated flexible arrays
instead of just saying "oh no a flexible array, I give up".

That ship has sailed, and it has been keeping things at bay for a while
now. As we make progress on making the compiler able to do this more
naturally, we can work on replacing struct_size(), but it's in use
globally and it's useful both for catching runtime mistakes and for
catching compile-time mistakes (the flexible array has to match the
variable's struct).

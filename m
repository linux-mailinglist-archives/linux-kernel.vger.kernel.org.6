Doesn't DAMON already provide this information?

I'm not sure about more accurate.

Access frequency is only half the picture. Whether you need to keep
memory with a given frequency resident depends on the speed of the
backing device.

There is memory compression; there is swap on flash; swap on crappy
flash; swapfiles that share IOPS with co-located filesystems. There is
zswap+writeback, where avg refault speed can vary dramatically.

You can of course offload much more to a fast zswap backend than to a
swapfile on a struggling flashdrive, with comparable app performance.

So I think you'd be hard pressed to achieve a high level of accuracy
in the usecases you list without taking the (often highly dynamic)
cost of paging / memory transfer into account.

There is a more detailed discussion of this in a paper we wrote on
proactive reclaim/offloading - in 2.5 Hardware Heterogeneity:

You can do this with a recent (>2018) upstream kernel and ~100 lines
of python [1]. It also works on both LRU implementations.

[1] https://github.com/facebookincubator/senpai

We use this approach in virtually the entire Meta fleet, to offload
unneeded memory, estimate available capacity for job scheduling, plan
future capacity needs, and provide accurate memory usage feedback to
application developers.

It works over a wide variety of CPU and storage configurations with no
specific tuning.

The paper I referenced above provides a detailed breakdown of how it
all works together.

I would be curious to see a more in-depth comparison to the prior art
in this space. At first glance, your proposal seems more complex and
less robust/versatile, at least for offloading and capacity gauging.

It does provide more detailed insight into userspace memory behavior,
which could be helpful when trying to make sense of applications that
sit on a rich layer of libraries and complicated runtimes. But here a
comparison to DAMON would be helpful.

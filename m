I would say at a minimum it is to provide a means to cap the PCRs. 
Devices with TPM1.2 are still prevalent in the wild for which members of 
the TrenchBoot community support, and there are still valid (and secure) 
verification uses for SHA1 that I outlined in my previous response.

Our goal is to keep control in the hands of the user, not making 
unilateral decisions on their behalf. In the currently deployed 
solutions it is left to the initrd (user) to cap the PCRs. After some 
thinking, we can still ensure user control and give an option to cap the 
PCRs earlier. We hope to post a v11 later this week or early next week 
that introduces a new policy field to the existing measurement policy 
framework. Will add/update the kernel docs with respect to the policy 
expansion. We are also looking the best way we might add a warning to 
the kernel log if the SHA1 bank is used beyond capping the PCRs.

Hopefully this answers the outstanding comments on the SHA1 thread.

v/r,
dps

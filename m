No. The request has always been that they don't want the PMU driver to
do the PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE/PERF_COUNT_HW_* to PMU/config=3D??? mapping
given the diversity of hardware and to keep the PMU driver simple.
Here is Atish's feedback:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHBxVyH1q5CRW3emWTZu1oLZEfTWWVRH6B0OVggFxt-0N=
RzvwQ@mail.gmail.com/
"""
If the overriding legacy with JSON is available, each future vendor
may just provide the json file instead of modifying the driver.
"""
Because of the pain in landing the reverted patch then RISC-V has had
to work with perf's behavior as it is, they need to ship products. I
think things would have been simpler in their driver and the wider
ecosystem if this hadn't been forced to happen.

There is only one known issue of a problem for 1 event on 1 ARM model.
If ARM renamed the event this wouldn't be an issue. The patch series
works for this event but warns about it if you try to use it with perf
record.

So this has never made sense to me. To be specific, if I do:
$ perf record -e data_read -a true
then data_read is an uncore_imc_free_running event that doesn't
support sampling. With the change you say then rather than a warning
and failure, as currently happens, you are proposing that the command
exits and doesn't warn. This is an extension of the only warn if
verbose and ignore failing cycles event you mention. The problem is
that there are scripts that look for the failure message, I think it
is also surprising for users.

Why do I know scripts check the output? perf's own tests started
breaking because we weren't exiting when events failed to open. We
routinely grep the perf output in those tests, I'm not aware of a
specific case with perf record but given we do it with perf stat, then
it doesn't seem unreasonable. For example, looking for "Access to
performance monitoring and observability operations is limited." in
the perf stat warning output:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools-next.git/tr=
ee/tools/perf/tests/shell/stat_all_pmu.sh?h=3Dperf-tools-next#n31
but I mean it is routine as we rely on values like "<not supported>"
being in the output, although I'd say more tests infer this from the
exit code of the perf command being tested. Fwiw, it is common in
Google's testing to not just expect an exit code but also a specific
error message.

It is in the cover letter:
```
v4: Rework the no events opening change from v3 to make it handle
    multiple dummy events. Sadly an evlist isn't empty if it just
    contains dummy events as the dummy event may be used with "perf
    record -e dummy .." as a way to determine whether permission
    issues exist. Other software events like cpu-clock would suffice
    for this, but the using dummy genie has left the bottle.

    Another problem is that we appear to have an excessive number of
    dummy events added, for example, we can likely avoid a dummy event
    and add sideband data to the original event. For auxtrace more
    dummy events may be opened too. Anyway, this has led to the
    approach taken in patch 3 where the number of dummy parsed events
    is computed. If the number of removed/failing-to-open non-dummy
    events matches the number of non-dummy events then we want to
    fail, but only if there are no parsed dummy events or if there was
    one then it must have opened. The math here is hard to read, but
    passes my manual testing.
```

I think this is what the series achieves:
1) encoding is consistent cycles =3D=3D cpu/cycles/ - which I think has to
be a goal for basic sanity;
2) the wildcard matching is consistent cpu_cycles will match on every
PMU, cpu-cycles will match on every PMU, the behavior of hybrid is
consistent with uncore, etc.;
3) "most people" is open to interpretation, I think this series fixes
problems making "most people" happier. Specifically:
3.1) fixes a latent bug on ARM Apple-M CPUs due to broken legacy
mappings, the whole reason the priority was flipped due to a broken
PMU,
3.2) addresses RISC-V's issues,
3.3) allows ARM's neoverse not to fail for `perf record -e cycles ...`
but warns about the PMU event inconsistency.
The series also continues the push to make perf generic, avoid having
special "hey if it is this do magic" type things,  and so on.

The problem with "no surprise" was that we've moved past a world of
just 1 core PMU. A decision was made to make legacy events wildcard,
and without my input Jiri Olsa and yourself reviewed and merged those
changes. Fixing those changes to not be hardcoded to cpu_atom/cpu_core
(arguably something that should never have been allowed to be merged
in the 1st place given its obviously non-generic nature) broke ARM
Apple-M and we made legacy events lower priority than sysfs/json to
fix this as multiple people strongly requested (their proposal was
just to revert 6 or more Linux releases worth of perf tool changes
including adding Intel topdown metric support that I'd written). The
move away from just a core PMU will continue as systems have greater
heterogeneity and you are likely already spending more money on
accelerators like GPUs than on your core PMU - something I keep
pushing the perf tool to support, for example with hwmon and drm
PMUs/events. Even 15 years ago this trend was clear.

I think making it so that events fail to open and requiring a "-v"
flag is surprising - "-v" is far too spammy for regular users. I think
the perf_event_attr encoding of cpu-cycles not matching
cpu/cpu-cycles/ is surprising. I think inst_retired.any matching
events on all PMUs, but cycles only matching core PMUs (how should a
user even know what these are?) is surprising.

The series is trying to make "most people" happy with "no surprise"
for them unless their hardware vendor happens to name an event on an
uncore PMU to match a legacy event - there is only 1 known instance of
this. There is a 4 character fix for that, specifically the cycles
event should be "cpu_cycles" for consistency with the "bus_cycles"
event, as cycles could imply either. The line of code where this 4
character change is necessary is here:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/dri=
vers/perf/arm_dsu_pmu.c#n177
Given we live in a world where ARM PMU names mean we don't see core
PMUs in perf list (very surprising behavior imo) the work to fix that
will be a lot more invasive than a 1 event name change on an uncore
PMU.

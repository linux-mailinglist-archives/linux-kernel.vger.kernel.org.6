Thank you for confirming.  If there is a way that DAMON could generate
[0x, 0x1100], that's a bug that deserves its own fix.  So let's assume it
cannot happen for now.

You're right, thank you.

Now, the next question would be, could that ('damon_va_evenly_split_region()'
being called with 1 'nr_pieces') trigger some issues?  Based on the code, I
don't think so.  Please let me know if I'm missing some corner cases.

Nice suggestion, thanks.  I agree that making it be handled is better in terms
of maintenance.  It would make the code much easier to read.

It wouldn't be for a fix of a bug, but for making the code easier to read.  So
I think posting it as a separate patch is better.  If you don't mind, please
post a patch.

A case that damon_va_evenly_split_region() is called with nr_pieces of value 1
exists.

A case that the function is called with DAMON_MIN_REGION un-aligned region
doesn't exist (unless there is a bug).

I was saying about the second case.  I still agree doing the nr_pieces check is
good for readability, so please post a patch if you don't mind.

I agree.  Nonetheless, let's make it be separated with the real bug fix.

As mentioned above, now I think having this is good for readability, but let's
make it an individual change that separated from the real bug fix.

So, let's add the 'nr_pieces == 1' check, but as a change that separated from
the real bug fix.  I'm looking forward to your next posts, Zheng :)

Nonetheless, please note that the real bug is not somewhat critical for users.
It only has a potential to slightly degrade the best-effort accuracy of DAMON
in corner cases.


Thanks,
SJ

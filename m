Back in 2018 at LA, I think it was LSS, there was BoF where this was
discussed I said that for me this feature does not necessarily make
sense since data centers tend to have armed guards, and not black hat
would ever take a even a minor risk of getting hole in the head :-)

After that the whole ecosystem has changed, especially thanks to what
Apple has done with their security chip and user friendly encrypted
boot process, and that has reflected to systemd and the use TPM2,
and thus as a feature bus protection has become relevant.

So also based on these old conclusions I had I fully agree that we
need such a flag to balance things between desktop/laptop and server
use cases, which are both quite relevant. E.g. just me personally
I really enjoy the experience of being able to boot my ThinkPad=20
with encryption and without having to type a passphrase per
boot.

I.e. the buy-in part is totally addressed as far as I'm concerned :-)

BR, Jarkko

If anyone wants to play, basic emulation on my CXL QEMU staging tree
https://gitlab.com/jic23/qemu/-/commit/e89b35d264c1bcc04807e7afab1254f35ffc8cb9

Branch with a few other things on top is:
https://gitlab.com/jic23/qemu/-/commits/cxl-2024-11-27

Note that this currently doesn't produce real data.  I have a plan
/ initial PoC / hack to hook that up via an addition to the QEMU cache
plugin and an external tool to emulate the hotness tracker counting
hardware. Will be a little while before I get that finished, so in
a meantime the above exercises the driver.

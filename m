Yes, there's somewhat a lack of reports of TPM issues but I can't tell
if that's because people aren't using them in anger, or if they're just
not having any issues.

This is seen across thousands of machines, so it's not a specific TPM
issue.

Ah. So the problem I've described is transient; we get a timeout, that
sometimes causes problems (e.g. the transient space leakage I've
previously sent a patch for), but ultimately the TPM responds just fine
next time.

We _do_ have a separate issue where the TPM returns 0xFFFF for STS, the
kernel does the "invalid TPM_STS.x" with stack thing, then the TPM never
responds to a command again until a machine reboot. However in that
instance it _does_ still respond to reading the TPM_DID_VID register,
and allowing entering/leaving locality, so that looks like it's firmly a
TPM problem of some sort.

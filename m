May it would be nice to have a way to "zap" userspace away, i.e. allow
the kernel to get rid of all processes in some way, reliable. And then
simply start a new userspace, from a trusted definition. Or in other
words: if you don't want to trust the usual userspace, then let's
maybe just terminate it, and create it anew, with a clean, pristine
definition the old userspace cannot get access to.

ebpf is not turing complete, I am not sure how far you will make it
with this, in the various implementations of EFI payloads there are
plenty of loops, sometimes IO loops, sometimes hash loops of huge data
(for measurements). As I understand ebpf is not really compatible such
code.

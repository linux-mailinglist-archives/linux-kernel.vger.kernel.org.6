This is hardly a SWIOTLB problem. If a driver allows its device to 
corrupt what is effectively driver-internal data, then the device can 
still easily crash a non-coherent system without SWIOTLB, by writing a 
DMA address for which phys_to_virt() returns a bogus unmapped VA which 
causes a cache maintenance instruction to fault. Or potentially do far 
worse by redirecting a DMA_FROM_DEVICE cache invalidation to some other 
valid VA to destroy some recently-written data.

Even with an IOMMU, whilst it should be relatively contained, it would 
still be able to mess with the IOMMU pagetables by causing unmapping of 
wrong IOVAs, and spam up the kernel log with warnings and driver errors 
(more than it already could) as the iommu-dma state gets progressively 
more out-of-sync with itself over repeated shenanigans.

I also have no issue with changing a BUG_ON() to a WARN() where the 
former is gratuitously unnecessary anyway - a common precedent in the 
SWIOTLB code, it seems - but let's not pretend we're meaningfully 
mitigating anything here. If a driver has made this naive assumption 
about DMA addresses, who knows how many other ways it could also be 
confused by a malicious device writing unexepected values to descriptor 
fields?

Thanks,
Robin.

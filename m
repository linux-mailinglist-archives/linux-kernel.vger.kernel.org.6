Even with DWARF that is not always available, IIRC it depends on
compiler flags how much DWARF is generated.

Right, that is something we discussed in this GSoC cycle, to have extra
BTF generated from the scraper scripts, not in the kernel's BTF, but
with perf, but then that would work for ABIs, and not for internal
kernel stuff, where, as you rightly described, CO-RE would come to save
the day.

Having some extra BTF info, not necessarily in a kernel module or things
like that, but from a debuginfo server, in an extra rpm package,
whatever, but accessible via a build-id lookup somehow would be a great
improvement.

We need to keep talking about this to make it a reality :-)

See above, maybe we don't really need to have it as a loadable kernel
module.

No work in the weekend, but took most of today :-)

I'm pushing what I have to the tmp.perf-tools-next branch at:

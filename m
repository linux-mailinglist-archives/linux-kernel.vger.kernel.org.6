I see what you mean.

If you have hardware that supports cpu BBML2 but doesn't support smmu
BBML2, either by virtue of having a pre-SMMUv3.2 smmu, or by only
implementing BBML1, the simplest option I see is then to disable BBML2
globally in the kernel. A bad klude, but would at least leave current
SVA working.

Yes, I agree. I believe that for larger cores, this is a guarantee that
implementors will be able to make when adding themselves to the list.
They know what smmu their core uses, and that tends to be
performance-focused (hence more likely to use an smmu that support
BBML2).

For smaller cores, i.e. mobile cores, this becomes a larger issue as you
may have a higher likelyhood of pairing such a core with an
older/insufficient smmu version. So, careful consideration is required.

I agree in principle with having, as you point out, some mechanism
to disable BBML2 when an smmu without BBML2 is used. However, I think
that the complexity of such a mechanism depends on how the BBML2 feature
is used by future patches.

For example, if we use BBML2 for kernel mappings, does that require us
to repaint all kernel mappings when disabling BBML2 on smmu attach? I
am not sure, but definitely something to be worked out.

Yes, in this scenario, it's indeed challenging to determine the
appropriate size for the global pool. Therefore, a feasible approach is
to initially configure a larger value. Once the software is running
within the container successfully, the maximum value for the container
and the size of the system's global pool can be determined based on the
peak value, otherwise, increase the size of the global pool and try
again. so I believe the peak metric is useful for this scenario.

I think it breaks what groups are as well. At least, you cannot
guarantee that two events can be co-scheduled on the same CPU. Even
worse, there could be no events on some CPU.
The first thing that pops up is the sample read feature. On CPU_A, the
event_A is the leader event, but on CPU_B, the event_B could be the
leader event if event_A's cpumask doesn't include the CPU_B.
There could be more similar features we have to special handle.

The no cpus/cpumasks and empty cpumasks should be different.
No cpus/cpumasks file means that the counters/events are available for
all the CPUs.
But if it's an empty cpus/cpumasks file, it means that there are no
proper CPUs. It may happen on a hybrid machine when all e-core CPUs are
hot-removed. Since it's possible that the CPUs can be hot-added later,
the kernel driver doesn't unregister the cpu_atom PMU.

The multiplexing is triggered when there are not enough counters. It
should not related to the cpumask.

For the PMU without cpumask, I think the test case should try to open an
event on all CPUs and check if the open succeeds.
For the PMU with cpumask, the test case should try to open an event on
the masked CPUs and check if the open succeeds.

The behavior of opening an event on unmasked CPUs seems not defined.
For uncore, it's OK. The kernel treats the CPUs from the same socket
exactly the same. But I'm not sure about the other PMUs.

The rest sounds good to me.

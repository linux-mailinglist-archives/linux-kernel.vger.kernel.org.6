Got it. Thanks for the clarification.

IIUC, the generated metrics are based on the best knowledge of
contributors. The initial source is from Google's tree. It should be the
contributor's responsibility to maintain or update the metrics.
If so, I agree that it should be a good supplement.

I would have some comments in general.
- I think we need a way to distinguish these metrics, e.g., add a
dedicated prefix. I will not be surprised if some customers bring the
metrics to Intel or other vendor's customer service, and ask why it
doesn't work on some platforms. I don't think they will get any useful
information there. The best way is to report any issues here. So we can
fix and update the metric.
- All events, no matter whether they are from the JSON file or exposed
by the kernel, have to be checked before showing the metrics. Because we
cannot guarantee the availability of an event, even for the
architectural events. We may introduce a wrapper for the Metric() to
check all the involved events. So we don't need to add the try: except
thing in each patch?
- In the perf test, it's better to ignore the errors from these metrics.
So it doesn't block things. But we can show a warning from them with
-vvv. The issue can still be found and fixed.

Thanks,
Kan

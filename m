Hello Ian,

Thanks for your email explaining the concerns.

No, it's my fault.  Please move the declaration into the same patch.

I think it's different than drivers which can be separated by a config
option easily and highly hardware dependent.  Or maybe it's just a
maintainers' preference.

I don't agree.  The intention is to help other's understanding of the
code.  Well I agree it will require more effort for the author, but I
believe that having the code more digestible size would benefit in the
long run.

I feel like the whole perf code base is getting bigger, harder to know
all the details.  So I'm asking contributors to do more work to reduce
the burden in some way.

I'm sorry that you felt that way.  I was trying to improve the code and
keep the code simple and concise.  But it's sometimes hard to draw the
line where it's acceptable.  Probably my previous decisions were bad,
but I tried to be reasonable as much as possible.

I don't know we have that in other place.  So I was curious if we care
about other platforms.  Probably we can just delete the unused code, but
as I said, I can live with this.

Well I think you changed the numbering in the parallel testing and I
asked to keep it continuous as of now.

I think we're fine except for the register naming.  I haven't reviewed
that part yet and I'll do that next week.

It's sad we broke some arch.  But it should be easy to fix the tool
than the kernel driver.  Let's find a way to fix the problems in a
better way.  Sorry if I missed some previous discussion.

This is a new code that requires complex and non-intuitive operations
like mixing perf record and perf stat together.  I remember some people
doubt about the approach so it may deserve stricter and longer reviews.

Even then, I tried to review quickly and accepted some minor
disasgreements.  It's unfortunate it took too long but it happens.

Right it works great, thanks for your effort.

But I think any collaborating work needs some kind of burden (or
stalling) for coordination.  If said patches touch a lot of area, there
is a high chance of rebase, more arguments on the interface, etc.

Thanks for your hard work.  Maybe I'm the bottleneck of your
productivity.  But I cannot take patches without review, and reviewing
patches take time.  Having more active reviewers would help.

At least for this case, I don't think moving the declaration would cause
you a lot of trouble.  Please take a look at my updated 'perf/hwmon-pmu'
branch again.

For the magical maintainer threshold, I admit it can be different to
each maintainer.  But I think it's the review process to find a point of
agreement.  I don't know where it is even by myself but we can argue
each other.

Thanks,
Namhyung

I understand your concern.  But I want to make it not very strictly fixed and
well-defined term, but just somewhat understandable with common sense and given
context, for flexibility and conciseness.  So unless this is really makes it
difficult to understand what it means even with common senses and the context
I'd like to keep current form.

I believe your answer to the above question is "no" since you mentioned you
won't stick to your term.  Please let me know if I'm misreading you.

I think this patch makes the point pretty explicit, so my humble brain is bit
confused what "more explicit" really means.  Could you please clarify what
changes you want to be added?


Thanks,

We double confirmed with our HW design team today, there is only one
input PIN to CMN PLL hardware block which is always sourced from the
internal Wi-Fi hardware block.

Let me provide more details below on the function of this block, to
provide a clear picture of the clock functions involved.

Input clock
-----------
This input clock rate at the pin is usually 48 MHZ, but an input rate of
96 MHZ at this pin is also supported by the block. Below is a picture
showing how input clocks are used in CMNPLL.

48mhz(or 96mhz)--->IN-clk-pin--->IN-clk-divider->(final-IN-clk)-->
CMNPLL HW logic-->out-clks

As per the input reference clock at the pin, the divider value is
configured on it. The register field CMN_PLL_REFCLK_INDEX is only used
to configure the final input clock rate (after the divider is applied)
to the CMNPLL HW logic.

So in summary, there is only one input clock pin. The register field
name CMN_PLL_REFCLK_INDEX (from hardware register description) may be
confusing, but it is actually only used to indicate the final input
clock rate to the CMNPLL hardware logic. I will clarify this with
additional comments in the code.

Core clock
-----------
The CMNPLL hardware block runs at 12 GHZ clock. It is automatically
derived from the input clock and no configuration required.

Output clock
------------
The CMNPLL block generates the all the output clocks (For ex: the 353
MHZ clock to PPE) without any software configuration required. The
driver only configures the input clock rate as described above.

OK.

OK, understand. However it seems like set_parent() method may not be an
option since there is only one parent clock input pin.

Given the description above on the input clock function and the fact
that there is a single parent clock, could you suggest whether the
clk_ops::set_rate()/'assigned-clock-rates' method can be used to
configure the input clock rate?

We also looked at the determine_rate() method suggested, and felt that
this may not be feasible for this hardware model. This is because there
are more than one possible input clock rates (48 MHZ and 96 MHZ), and
hence it would not be feasible to derive a required input clock rate
from the core clock rate (12 GHZ).

As described previously, there is only input clock pin with two possible
input clock rates (48 MHZ and 96 MHZ), and the index field only selects
the final input clock rate after applying the divider. There is no mux
function in the hardware.

The CMNPLL block generates the all the output clocks for a given SoC
without any software configuration required. The output clocks and their
rates are different on the different IPQ SoC. For example, the output
clock to PPE (Packet Process Engine hardware block) is 353 MHZ on
IPQ9574 and 200 MHZ on IPQ5332. The input clock rate of CMN PLL on
these two IPQ SoC is the same, but the internal logic of CMN PLL
which differs per SoC type ensures that the right output clocks are
generated for the given SoC. There is no provision or need for
multiplier configuration by software, to generate the output clocks.

The CMN PLL core clock runs at 12 GHZ.

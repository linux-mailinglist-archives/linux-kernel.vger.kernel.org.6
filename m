Sure NULL means optional and has since the dawn of time, I don't see
this adding anything to the conversation. What is remarkable here is
passing around a collection of function pointers, then the caller of
the function pointer is supposed to check whether what you want to be
an optional value (I don't, nor does the existing code) function
pointer is present, and if not present the caller needs to know to
call another special function. This is complicated enough that the
function calls could use helper macros, e.g.:

#define CALL_TOOL_SAMPLE(tool, event, sample, evsel, machine) \
  if (tool->sample) \
    tool->sample(tool, event, sample, machine); \
  else \
    process_event_sample_stub(tool, event, sample, machine);

you need about 38 of them. Now if I'm a buildtin_cmd writer wanting to
know what gets called on tool, I need to check, do all callers of the
tool use the macro? Perhaps the user decided to do their own NULL test
and call a different function. Cases like tool->finished_round already
need to go to one of two different stubs. There is clearly more
cognitive load on the tool API user as now they must check all uses of
38 function pointers across the code base to understand the behavior
of the tool, they can't just rely on the function pointer in the
struct being the place the code will go. A simple function pointer
call has imo become spaghetti.

There is also the overhead checking the optional value - I've never
seen a C programmer wanting to do this in 30 years of doing paid C
development, the use of the function pointer was to avoid checking,
etc. But maybe the kernel does this and it's an existing kernel style?
I can't find it.

Thanks,
Ian

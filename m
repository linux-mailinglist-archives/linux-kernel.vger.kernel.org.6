Trying to page this back in, I think there are three stages:

1. A KVM cap that the VMM can use to check for non-device PFNMAP (or
   rather cacheable PFNMAP since we already support Normal NC).

2. Memslot registration - we need a way for the VMM to require such
   cacheable PFNMAP and for KVM to check. Current patch relies on (a)
   the stage 1 vma attributes which I'm not a fan of. An alternative I
   suggested was (b) a VM_FORCE_CACHEABLE vma flag, on the assumption
   that the vfio driver knows if it supports cacheable (it's a bit of a
   stretch trying to make this generic). Yet another option is (c) a
   KVM_MEM_CACHEABLE flag that the VMM passes at memslot registration.

3. user_mem_abort() - follows the above logic (whatever we decide),
   maybe with some extra check and WARN in case we got the logic wrong.

The problems in (2) are that we need to know that the device supports
cacheable mappings and we don't introduce additional issues or end up
with FWB on a PFNMAP that does not support cacheable. Without any vma
flag like the current VM_ALLOW_ANY_UNCACHED, the next best thing is
relying on the stage 1 attributes. But we don't know them at the memslot
registration, only later in step (3) after a GUP on the VMM address
space.

So in (2), when !FWB, we only want to reject VM_PFNMAP slots if we know
they are going to be mapped as cacheable. So we need this information
somehow, either from the vma->vm_flags or slot->flags.

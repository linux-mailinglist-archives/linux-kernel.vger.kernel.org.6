Yup, that's mostly how I think of it.

Obtaining a mapping from the xPU driver must result in VM_PFNMAP being
set in the VMA. I don't think that's particularly controversial.

The memslot must also be created with a new flag ((2c) in the taxonomy
above) that carries the "Please map VM_PFNMAP VMAs as cacheable". This
flag is only allowed if (1) is valid.

This results in the following behaviours:

- If the VMM creates the memslot with the cacheable attribute without
  (1) being advertised, we fail.

- If the VMM creates the memslot without the cacheable attribute, we
  map as NC, as it is today.

What this doesn't do is *automatically* decide for the VMM what
attributes to use. The VMM must know what it is doing, and only
provide the memslot flag when appropriate. Doing otherwise may eat
your data and/or take the machine down (cacheable mapping on a device
can be great fun). If you want to address this, then "someone" needs
to pass some additional VMA flag that KVM can check.

Of course, all of this only caters for well behaved userspace, and we
need to gracefully handle (3) when the VMM sneaks in a new VMA that
has conflicting attributes.

For that, we need a reasonable fault reporting interface that allows
userspace to correctly handle it. I don't think this is unique to this
case, but also covers things like MTE and other funky stuff that
relies on the backing memory having some particular "attributes".

An alternative could be to require the VMA to be sealed, which would
prevent any overlapping mapping. But I only have looked at that for 2
minutes...

Thanks,

	M.

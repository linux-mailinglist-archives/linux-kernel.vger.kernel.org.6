I'd just take what makes sense for each driver. dev_name() would be a 
good approximation.

I agree that cardN is not stable.

I've used your patch as a base enable cgroup in drivers that use the 
VRAM manager. I didn't want to enable it for all of GEM, because it 
would conflict with drivers using TTM. Some more discussion is needed first.

For DMA-BUF heaps, I think it's fine and there is a lot less need of 
discussion. I just felt it should be sent separately from the initial 
enablement.

I agree, just put it out there for discussion. I don't think the 
benefits weigh up against the downsides :-)

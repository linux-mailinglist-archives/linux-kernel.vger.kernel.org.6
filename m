What do you mean with "care"?

I didn't change any behavior to what's happening now, if e.g. qcom,ipc-3
is not set right now then the driver is okay with that and just won't
ring the mailbox for that smsm host.

The behavior will be the same with mbox, if a mbox for e.g. the 3rd smsm
host is not set, the driver is okay with that but then of course won't do
anything for that host.

See the driver patch for details, or is something unclear there?

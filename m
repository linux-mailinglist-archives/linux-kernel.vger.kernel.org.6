I am familiar with the "genl" e.g. as in genlmsghdr. However, it wasn't
immediately straight-forward to me the connection as it would have been
with "netlink".

I don't know what the convention is for this type of generic netlink
interfaces. Perhaps "genl" is more appropriate, I just know that using
"netlink" would have been more straight-forward (at least to me).

Maybe most others that are new to this binder interface will go through
the same "discovery" process I went through.

Short is fine. However, what is "SET"? In the future we might add more
commands to this interface and I can see this name being a problem at
that point.

I'm absolutely confused as to what is "delayed" then? Isn't it async &&
frozen?

A spam transaction can be if the caller has >=25% of the target's buffer
capacity or over 50 transactions, regardless of whether the target is
frozen or not.

It seems to me these are two independent scenarios and a transaction can
be either one or both.

I mean that without the flags check binder_genl_set_report() is small
enough and the only caller is this. So you could just delete that
function and write the code here in binder_genl_nl_set_doit().

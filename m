Completely agree. Although I'm not sure about the name - analyzing
DSDT of Tributo it seems there are quite a few more things defined
than particular laptop utilizes, eg. support for x3 TypeC and x3 USB
MP while current device only has x2 TypeC and x1 USB MP. I believe
these are either leftovers of examples being provided to Dell which
were just left there, or ACPI tables being (at least partially?)
shared between multiple platforms - eg. Inspiron 14" 7441/Latitude 14"
5455 etc. In the latter case (unfortunately cannot test myself due to
lack of hw) perhaps the .dtsi can be inherited by more than just XPS
family. If you/Kemp Bryan could share some insight on that already wrt
to how much is shared (if any), I can split to dtsi/dts with upcoming
re-spin. Otherwise indeed can be done when the next platform is being
introduced.

Yes, will drop 'tributo' altogether. Perhaps "../dell/xps13-9345"
then, to match the proposed compat? Also when Divo/Huracan/Perfomante
will come out, those are still "XPS" but I would guess will have
different firmware files, so maybe it makes sense to be a bit more
precise with the naming?

Alex

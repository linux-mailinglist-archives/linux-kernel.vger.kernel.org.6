The ctx->time is shared among PMUs. The core PMU doesn't want the time
in the guest mode, but other PMUs, e.g., uncore, still need it.
So we do need to track the time in the guest mode.

Something as below is planed to be implemented in the V3.
The host ctx should keeps active in the guest mode as well.
The event of core PMU will deduct the time of the guest mode.
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-perf-users/902c40cc-6e0b-4b2f-826c-457f533a0a76@linux.intel.com/

For example,
perf stat -e cpu/cycles/H,uncore_cha_0/event=0x1/ -C0 -vvv sleep 16

(when the perf command runs, a guest runs ~8s at the same CPU.)

cpu/cycles/H: 55426106 7813838542 7813838542
uncore_cha_0/event=0x1/: 14302016384 16004903742 16004903742

 Performance counter stats for 'CPU(s) 0':

        55,426,106      cpu/cycles/H
    14,302,016,384      uncore_cha_0/event=0x1/

      16.034896147 seconds time elapsed

The time_enabled and time_running for cycles is 7813838542.
For uncore_cha_0/event=0x1/, it's 16004903742.

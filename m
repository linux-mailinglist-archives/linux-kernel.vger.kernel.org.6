We did see the test failure on our Ampere test machine 7 days ago, but
for some reason only on mainline (I was also on holiday at the same
time). I'm checking if that machine is running all the branches and will
make sure it does from now on.

We are running perf-tools-next on other machines and I try to look at
all the test failures. Just this one had a bit of an obscure combination
of needing the DSU PMU.

One thing we don't have in CI is any Apple M hardware. I can look into
it but I wouldn't have high hopes for anything soon.

Not sure about that one, that would break anyone's scripts or tools that
are looking at DSU cycles. And it wouldn't fix the issue in the future
if there were other reasons the event doesn't open (like non sampling
core events, or someone's brand new uncore PMU that also has a cycles
event).

It seems like we're converging one something that works though in the
other threads, but I'm still digesting the problems a bit.

Okay, understood.

By well-defined I meant there isn't a proper documentation of what is meant by non-secure-domain.

Yes, there are a few platforms where this property is added for ADSP.

FastRPC nodes were recently added to this devicetree recently. Looks like this property is just getting copied.
It might be that fastrpc was recently tried on ChromeOS device or it might be added to support some other devices
that uses fastrpc(qcm6490-idp etc.).

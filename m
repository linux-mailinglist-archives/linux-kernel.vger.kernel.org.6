As the attempt was made to lay in the policy logic, it started to become 
convoluted and unnecessarily complicated. Thus creating more risk with 
all the bookkeeping and yet sha1 hashes still have to be sent, the null 
hash in this case, since the TPM driver will reject extends that do not 
have hashes for all active banks. At this point, we have opted to keep 
the logic simple and add a section to our documentation advising of the 
potential risk should one choose to incorporate SHA1 in their 
attestations of the platform.

v/r,

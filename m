Chances are that clock was enabled by the bootloader for us (or it's
just enabled by default) and it just keeps running. If that's so, I'd
say it must be described in dts and controlled by the driver. Because
otherwise it might get disabled at any point in future, e.g. kernel
may disable it during startup as an unused clock (when it's added to
the clock driver), etc. Let me enable that clock for you, and then you
can use /sys/kernel/debug/clk/ files to disable it manually and see if
it actually affects TMU driver.

It feels like there is an error for Exynos7 case there. Take a look at
this commit:

    aef27b658b43 ("thermal: exynos: use sanitize_temp_error() in
exynos7_tmu_initialize()")

I think that commit just forgets to update the shift value for Exynos7
properly. This code:

    data->temp_error1 =3D trim_info & tmu_temp_mask;
    data->temp_error2 =3D ((trim_info >> EXYNOS_TRIMINFO_85_SHIFT) &
                EXYNOS_TMU_TEMP_MASK);

in case of Exynos7 becomes:

    data->temp_error1 =3D trim_info & 0x1ff;    // mask =3D 9 bits
    data->temp_error2 =3D (trim_info >> 8) & 0xff;

it contradicts itself, because it takes 9 rightmost bits for error1,
and then uses 1 of those bits for error2 too. It's obvious that if 9
bits are already used for error1, then for error2 it has to be shifted
by 9 bits, not 8.

That's why I think your patch 2/6 is legit and useful on its own, and
it's actually a good catch on your part! But the shift value has to be
fixed as well (for Exynos7). It's not ideal you don't have the
hardware to test it, but it just screams *bug* to me :) Also, maybe we
can ask someone who has Exynos7 hardware to test it for us?

Sure, it was just a minor suggestion to make the code look more linear
so to speak. It can be totally skipped.

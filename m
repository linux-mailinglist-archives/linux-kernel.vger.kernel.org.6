This was discovered through the meminfo observation program.
When the dma-buf is released, there is a noticeable increase in cache.

This may be triggered by pagecache when loading the algorithm model.

Additionally, the algorithm heap memory cannot benefit from the release 
of the dma-buf.
I believe this is related to the migratetype. The stack/heap cannot 
obtain priority access to
the dma-buf memory released by the kernel.(HIGHUSER_MOVABLE)

So, PMC break it, share each memory. Even if it's incorrect :)(If my 
understanding of the
fragmentation issue is incorrect, please correct me.)

The point you raised is indeed very likely to happen, as there is immense
memory pressure.
Currently, we only open the PMC when the application is in the foreground,
and close it when it goes to the background.
It is indeed unnecessary to drain the PMC when the application is in the 
foreground,
and a longer reaper timeout would be more useful.(Thanks for the 
flexibility provided by memcg.)

Yes, actually our heap configured order 8 4 0, but In our practical 
application and observation processes,
it is often difficult to meet the high-order memory allocation, so 
falling back to order 0 is the most common.
Therefore, for our MID_ORDER allocation, we use LOW_ORDER_GFP.
Just like the testing scenario I mentioned earlier, with 8GB of RAM and 
the camera peaking at around 3GB,

the fragmentation at this point will cause most of the DMA-BUF 
allocations to fall back to order 0.
The use of PMC is for real-world, high-load applications. I don't think 
it's very practical for regular applications.

Thanks

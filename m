Unfortunately, there is no easy way to fix this via the normal erratum
workaround "capability". The sanitised feature registers are handled
separately (initialised via init_cpu_features() for boot CPU and
sanitised eachtime via update_cpu_features).

Also we do not "enable" any capability (i.e. calling cpu_enable())
until the very end, after the CPUs are all brought up (except for boot 
CPUs).

But it may be possible to "fix up" the BBML2 feature in
cpuinfo_store_*cpu(), without using the "enable" call back.

Something like:

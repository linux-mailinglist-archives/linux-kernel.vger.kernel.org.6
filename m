Well, I was going to explain what EFI does, but it doesn't look
relevant now I've had a crash course reading the systemd-boot code.  It
looks like run() calls image_start() which loads the initrd itself. 
Then in initrd.c:initrd_prepare() it actually installs its own load
file2 protocol which is the protocol the kernel picks up when it loads
the initrd.  So whatever length the kernel is picking up is, in fact,
provided by systemd-boot.

I'd suspect something in this double indirection of load file protocols
is causing your length mismatch.

We don't use that at all in the EFI stub (and neither does systemd-
boot).  We use the protocols EFI provides to read fat volumes, so any
issue would be in the edk2 (or in your case ovmf) FatPkg.

It is?  Grub clearly appears in your log in event 37:

But I figured it out: shim is hard coded to look for grub.efi  In any
case, the entries match what systemd-boot would write (it seems to
insist that the string PCR is 12 instead of 8, which explains the log
entry).

However, this still doesn't explain the mismatch between the log and
the PCRs (even if you've got the wrong initrd hash, it should be
correctly recorded), but I suspect something updates them later in the
boot sequence without adding a log entry.

Thanks, that will at least tell me if something booting via systemd is
supposed to be able to match log entries on these PCRs (I'm suspecting
no is the answer).

I'm also trying to set up my own systemd-boot system.

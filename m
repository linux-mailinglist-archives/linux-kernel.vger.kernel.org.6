I applied the patches to 6.10~rc1 today and tried them on a Toradex
Verdin Board with an i.MX8MM.

The probing does not work for me.

I added some debug prints to see that the optee side properly detected
the need to reinit in tee_rpmb_init. The rpmb_ctx->key_verified is false
and the following call of rpmb_probe_reset fails which leads to the
panic of the TA trying to do a rpmb request.

Same codeflow can be seen earlier during probing the rpmb device but
without the panic.

I am not sure if I find time to look at it in more detail tomorrow.
Otherwise next week.

Thanks
Manuel

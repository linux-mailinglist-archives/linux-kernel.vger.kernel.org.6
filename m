There's the "this is for pm" type of device_link, they have a few
flavours. And if that doesn't yet cover ->shutdown, then I guess that
needs to be addressed.

The device_link (if you add it the correct way round) means a
provider-consumer relationship. Which means:

- driver core unbinds the consumer before the provider (e.g. on module
  unload)
- driver core disables the consumer before the provider for power
  management stuff
- driver core enables providers before consumers when enabling power again

So yeah this should work the right way round ...

The issue is that everyone just gives up, so it's not moving.

Can't we just flip the warnings around? Like make the hacky cleanup
conditional on the panel not yet being disabled/cleaned up, and complain
in that case only. With that:
- drivers which call shutdown shouldn't get a warning anymore, and also
  not a surplus call to drm_panel_disable/unprepare
- drivers which are broken still get the cleanup calls
- downside: we can't enforce this, because it's not yet enforced through
  device_link ordering

My issue is that you're trading an ugly warning that hurts maintenance
with an explicit list of working drivers, which also hurts maintenance.
Does seem like forward progress to me, just pushing the issue around.

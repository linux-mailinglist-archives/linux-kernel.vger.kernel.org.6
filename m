Yes.  Please prefer to use SHA-256.

Have you considered implementing I think it is SHA1-DC (as git has) that
is compatible with SHA1 but blocks the known class of attacks where
sha1 is actively broken at this point?

No offense to your Trenchboot project but my gut says that anything new
relying on SHA-1 is probably a bad joke at this point.

Firmware can most definitely be upgraded and if the goal is a more
secure boot the usual backwards compatibility concerns for supporting
old firmware really don't apply.

Perhaps hide all of the SHA-1 stuff behind CONFIG_TRENCHBOOT_PROTOTYPE
or something like that to make it clear that SHA-1 is not appropriate
for any kind of production deployment and is only good for prototyping
your implementation until properly implemented firmware comes along.

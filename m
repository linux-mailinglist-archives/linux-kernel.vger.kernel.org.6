Interesting.

Note, there is also a CUSTOM_TRACE_EVENT() macro that can attach to any
tracepoint (including those that have a TRACE_EVENT() already attached to
them) and create a new trace event that shows up into tracefs.

I still do not think "synthetic events" should be used for this purpose.
They are complex enough with the user interface we shouldn't have them
created in the kernel. That documentation should be rewritten to not make
it sound like the kernel or modules can create them.

That said, it doesn't mean you can't use dynamic events for this purpose.
Now what exactly is that "new_event!" doing?

I guess, what's different to that than a kprobe event? A kprobe event is a
dynamic trace event in the kernel. Could you do the same with that? Or is
this adding a nop in the code like a real event would?

I'm not against rust dynamic events, but I do not think synthetic events
are the answer. It will just cause more confusion.

I also added Alice to the Cc, as she has created trace events for Rust.

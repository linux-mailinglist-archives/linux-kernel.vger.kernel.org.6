Yes I was aware of this for in-tree modules, I was not aware of this for out of 
tree modules: 
https://gitlab.com/tuxedocomputers/development/packages/tuxedo-drivers/-/issues/137#note_2066858305

Sadly I did not get corrected on my mistake back then, otherwise I would have 
started then to get things moving and not only last Monday.

The revert was done not to block the release of the fan control for the Sirius, 
and as already mentioned in the commit: It is a temporary action.

I hoped to gain more time. TBH I feel a little bit of regret doing this 
experimentation in public now, as I would have had probably more time if i 
didn't (no offense).

It's about that second sentence "So you knew that it's legally [...]" which I 
explicitly stated that I was not e.g. 
https://gitlab.com/tuxedocomputers/development/packages/tuxedo-drivers/-/issues/137#note_2066858305 
from back in august.

Knowing the issue tracker too well, I know that day one of 6.13-rc1 release a 
discussion will might break loose that binds resources not invested in other stuff.

Also can you guarantee that it's not landing in 6.12(.0)?

That's why I asked for a clear timeframe to work with but I don't know if I can 
get one.

This would break linux installations on many devices and not only fall back on 
TUXEDO I honestly fear.

I was not around when the decision to license tuxedo-drivers (back then called 
tuxedo-cc-wmi) under GPL v3 was made, but I trust the people here that is was 
not done knowingly violating the GPL v2. And you did agree above that 
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") is somewhat unluckily named.

I guess what I try to convince you and others is that we _are_ taking Open 
Source licenses seriously, but still there are mistakes to be made, especially 
with complex projects like the Linux kernel, e.g. I'm not aware of any other 
project that uses a similar construct to EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL()/MODULE_LICENSE().

 Glad to hear!

 And even more so, I wasn't aware of this feature.  But this code doesn't 
make use of the WARN() facility, it just prints at the heightened KERN_ERR 
priority.

 Absolutely, I haven't questioned the removal of `%pK', but the switch to 
`%p' rather than `%px' specifically for this single hunk of your patch.

 Let me ask a different question then: is your approach to bulk-switch all 
instances of `%pK' to `%p' as the safe default and let other people figure 
out afterwards whether a different conversion specifier ought to be used 
instead on a case-by-case basis and then follow up with another patch, or 
will you consider these alternatives right away?

 I think it's important enough though for us to ensure we don't compromise 
it by chance.

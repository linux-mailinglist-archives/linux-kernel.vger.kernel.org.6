Yeah I was thinking about adding it as a default when the Coresight and 
SPE events are configured, but I think it's too much to expect for 
people to know all the edge cases about what the per PMU defaults will 
be. Having one default for all PMUs makes more sense to me.

I suppose asking Coresight users to add :H when they need it might be a 
less bad thing than this change to clean up the fragmentation in the 
defaults.

I expect most of the time if :H is not added things continue to work, 
just that more data will be recorded. One real concern is that in some 
configurations there is a limited buffer size and once it's filled you 
don't get any more data. If that buffer is filled by guest trace then 
maybe some Auto FDO flow could break. But it's kind of an edge case of 
an edge case and adding :H isn't really the end of the world.

Oh I see yes, the argument is a shortcut to adding H on all events 
and/or the default ones. I wasn't sure if was added because it couldn't 
be done with :H, but I see it's an alternative instead. So adding it 
makes sense.

Maybe this would be a good hint if it really is equivalent:

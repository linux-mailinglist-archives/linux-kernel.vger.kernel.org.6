Yeah, I think I finally found the real issue. I don't think we need the ref
counting. The problem is the creating and killing of the threads via the
start and stop callbacks. That's not their purpose. The purpose of stop
and start callbacks is when tracing_on is set to off and back on again. I
think this is what is racing with the close.

Anyway, the start and stop should probably just pause the threads and not
kill them an start them again. That is, the osnoise_workload_start() should
be called by the init callbacks and the osnoise_workload_stop should be
called by reset callback.

The start and stop callbacks should just pause and restart the the threads.

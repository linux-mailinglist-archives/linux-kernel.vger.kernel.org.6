No sure to understand the difference you do between eparate device-memory and
preallocated carveout.

In OP-TEE, we use the same principle as in Linux. OP-TEE uses memory regions
declared in its device tree to list memories usable for the coprocessor (with
associated access rights). On load, it checks that the segments to load  are
included in these memory regions.

Linux only declares the shared memory-regions in the device tree, for IPC.

> Does the OS need to retain @memref past this point?

No need,and as the area contains the reult of request_firmware() that can be
corrupted by Linux, OP-TEE considered this as a temporaray unsafe memory. After
the load + authentication step this buffer is no more used.
For detail, OPTEE make a copy of the header and TLV (metadata) in a secure
memory. and load the firmware images in destination memories All these memories
 are not accessible from the Linux.

Could you point me the code in Linux and your TEE, please?

Seems to me that there is also a partial Authentication done during the load step.

The differnce between the 2 implementations is the authentication method done in
2 steps for Qualcomm implementation , in one step for OP-TEE.

So here if I just remove the term 'authentication' in the command description
does it ok for you?

that seems fair, I notice that we will have to address this in a separate thread
strating with a series in Linux.

Regarding this comment and the one below, does following description would
respond to your expectations? else do you have a suggestion?

/*
 * This command should be used in case an error occurs between the loading of
 * the firmware images (TA_RPROC_CMD_LOAD_FW) and the starting of the remote
 * processor (TA_RPROC_CMD_START_FW), or after stopping the remote processor
 * (TA_RPROC_CMD_STOP_FW).
 *
 * This command is used to inform the TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) that
 * resources associated with the remote processor can be released. After this
 * command, the firmware is no longer present in the remote processor's memories
 * and must be reloaded (TA_RPROC_FW_CMD_LOAD_FW) to restart the remote
 * processor.
 */

It's a lot of math, and there is nothing memcontrol specific about it.
This makes it easier to use inside of the drm cgroup controller.

- * The following rules apply to the effective protection values:

- * 1. At the first level of reclaim, effective protection is equal to

- *
- * 2. To enable safe delegation of the protection configuration, at

- *    level. If that is the case, the parent's effective protection is
- *    distributed to the children in proportion to how much protection
- *    they have declared and how much of it they are utilizing.
- *
- *    This makes distribution proportional, but also work-conserving:

- * 4. Conversely, when the declared protection is undercommitted at a

- *    neutral wrt sibling cgroups and lets them compete freely over
- *    the shared parental protection budget, but it protects the

In all fairness, I think v5 is significantly less complex overall. Jeff
used his best judgement with a new header, and I don't think it's
unreasonable. That it is unwanted is fine, mm.h it is, but I think it's
clear the intent was trying to make this as least burdensome for the mm
subsystem as possible.

When I was reading through all of this and considering the history of
its development goals, it strikes me that a function is easier for the
future if/when this can be made a boot-time setting.

If mm maintainers prefer a #define for now, that's fine of course. The
value of VM_SYSTEM_SEAL can be VM_NONE on 32-bit.

Sounds good.

Yeah, I've really scratched my head over what the best practice is here.
There's a real mixture of "HAS" vs "SUPPORTS" across both hardware
architectural support, software features, interface implementations,
and compiler behavior that bridges between those. When I've looked in
the past, it seemed that "HAS" was in the majority, but I've never been
able to make sense of it.

Let me look again. Today, HAS shows:

$ git grep 'config .*_HAS_' | grep -v Documentation/ | \
  awk '{print $2}' | cut -d_ -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
      1 ARM
      1 MAC80211
      1 PGTABLE
      1 PPC
      1 RUSTC
      1 USB
      2 ARM64
      2 SIBYTE
      2 SOC
      3 FS
      3 PAHOLE
      6 SGI
      6 TOOLCHAIN
     10 ARC
     20 AS
     32 SYS
     34 CPU
     38 CC
    105 ARCH

Looking through them, it's tools (CC, AS, PAHOLE, etc), and
system/cpu/architecture prefixes, with ARCH being a clear winner.

SUPPORTS looks similar, but isn't as widely used:

$ git grep 'config .*_SUPPORTS_' | grep -v Documentation/ | \
  awk '{print $2}' | cut -d_ -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
      1 PPC64
      1 X86
      2 CLANG
      2 GCC
      2 RUSTC
      8 CPU
     38 SYS
     71 ARCH

The mips arch is using SYS, and distinguishes between HAS and SUPPORTS
in the sense of "this kernel HAS support for CPU $foo, which SUPPORTS
features x, y, z".

Looking through ARCH_SUPPORTS, it's all software features. Looking
through ARCH_HAS, it looks like a mix of hardware features
and software features. Some software features are more about
implementation availability, though (so "HAS" makes sense,
but should maybe be "IMPLEMENTS"?) e.g. ARCH_HAS_SYSCALL_WRAPPER,
ARCH_HAS_STRNLEN_USER, ARCH_HAS_FORTIFY_SOURCE, ARCH_HAS_ELF_RANDOMIZE,
ARCH_HAS_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX, ARCH_HAS_STRICT_MODULE_RWX.

So, I think I'd agree: this is about a software features and not an API
implementation nor hardware feature, so let's use ARCH_SUPPORTS_.

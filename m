I am fine with this fix but I have seen quite opposite argument. That is
not to add dependency if it is not strictly required.

Also since you state that the fix is to avoid users of other archs being
posed with the question that they may get annoyed or can't answer, I
wonder if the right approach is to make this driver default "n" instead.

I don't know what is the right or preferred approach here. I am fine
either way.

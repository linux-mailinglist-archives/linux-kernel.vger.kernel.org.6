It would be needed for per-thread mode if we didn't have the CPU sample
bit set on AUX records. Because otherwise you wouldn't know when the
process had moved to a new sink with new mappings. But I suppose this is
redundant information now that the CPU bit is set on AUX records so I
can remove this.

I was thinking it might be nice if a tool _only_ wanted to look at HWIDs
then it could do the decode correctly with just that. If we remove this
then tools will always have to set the CPU sample bit, but it's pretty
much required anyway and Perf was already doing it.

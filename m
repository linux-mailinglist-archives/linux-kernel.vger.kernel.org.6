Hi. Top-posting for once, to make this easily accessible to everyone.

Thx for the insights, but it feels like this is not the complete story.
From Takashi's mail earlier in the thread it appears to me that there is
a regression that the patch at the start of the thread fixes:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/87iktk4d9l.wl-tiwai@suse.de/

So it appears to me (please correct me if I'm wrong, which I might be)
there is some regression that must be fixed independently of any
firmware changes; not sure, maybe it's a different regression that the
one Marc saw.

I just don't know what's the best way forward to resolve the regresson.
A revert of the culprit? The patch at the start of this thread?
Something else?

Takashi, Luiz, can you help me out here? I guess I otherwise soon will
have to involve higher level maintainers to sort this out (e.g. the -net
maintainers and/or Linus).

Ciao, Thorsten

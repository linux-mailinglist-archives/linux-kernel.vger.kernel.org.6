I think the confusion maybe coming because v2 patch isn't where we
discussed to put the s_journal_destroying to true, in this thread [1]

   + sbi->s_journal_destroying = true;

We should add s_journal_destroying to true before calling for
flush_work. 

>   flush_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work)

After the above flush work is complete, we will always check if
s_journal_destroying is set. If yes, then we should never schedule the
sb update work

Then this schedule work will never happen, since it will check if
s_journal_destroying flag is set.

No need to again call the flush work here, since there is no new work
which will be scheduled right.

Am I missing something?

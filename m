OK, sorry for my misunderstanding, and thanks for the explanaiton. I've taken a
proper look at the patch and with this explanation now understand the intent.

I guess in effect, this is a scanning approach, but you are limiting the
clusters that you scan to those that were originally allocated for the required
order and which are known to have some free space.

I guess this will work more effectively with Barry's series that swaps in a
whole large folio in one go, because it is more likely that holes of the
required size will appear in the non-full clusters. But previous discussions
concluded that it was not always going to be the right approach to swap-in large
folios in one go (certainly not for higer orders). So I don't think you can
(yet) rely on swap slots being freed as order-sized blocks. That said I still
think that your approach should improve the situation even without Barry's series.

In fact, why don't you put the cluster on the non-full list at cluster
allocation time? Then you can also allow a cpu to steal from another cpu's
current cluster (as I initially thought you were doing). I think this should
work with pretty much the same logic? And improve chances of allocation without
increasing chances of fragmentation? (more on this below).

Yes, that would make sense; you could limit the number of clusters allocated for
each order at any given time.

Order-0 stealing will still cause problems. You could probably just remove that
and limit order-0 scanning/stealing to clusters that were originally allocated
for order-0 too, using the same logic.

You are preferring to scan the nonfull clusters over doing discard and
allocating a newly freed cluster; wouldn't it be better to prefer discard over
nonfull scanning?

I'm struggling a bit with what the value of the nonfull_clusters linked list is.
I wonder if it would be simpler to just track the number of free slots in the
cluster and iterate over the clusters, scanning the ones with the desired order
and which have at least (1 << order) free slots? I guess this list is giving you
an ordering such that the cluster you pull off the list first had its first slot
freed longest ago so it is most likely to have most space?

Yes agreed, my bad. Sorry about that.

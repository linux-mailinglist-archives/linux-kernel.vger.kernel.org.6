I'm fine using ifdefs in the current fine, but IMHO it's a matter of
whether we want to keep huge_memory.c growing into even larger file, and
keep all large folio logics only in that file.  Currently it's ~4000 LOCs.

Nornally I don't see this as much of a "code churn" category, because it
doesn't changes the code itself but only move things.  I personally also
prefer without code churns, but only in the case where there'll be tiny
little functional changes here and there without real benefit.

It's pretty unavoidable to me when one file grows too large and we'll need
to split, and in this case git doesn't have a good way to track such
movement..

Irrelevant of this, just to mention I think there's still one option that I
at least can make the huge pfnmap depends on THP again which shouldn't be a
huge deal (I don't have any use case that needs huge pfnmap but disable
THP, anyway..), so this series isn't an immediate concern to me for that
route.  But for a hugetlb rework this might be something we need to do,
because we simplly can't make CONFIG_HUGETLB rely on CONFIG_THP..

Thanks,

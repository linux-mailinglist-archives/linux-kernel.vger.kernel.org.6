For all the predefined parameter types, the module code would never set
the `default_active` value. It should be part of the data parsing
specification for the predefined argument types.

For custom parsing functions implemented in the module, it makes sense
specifying this value in the trait.

I think this would be confusing, since the default C parameter types do
not have this semantic. Specifying a default true boolean as an argument
does not make it false in C land. TBH this also feels like the most sane
thing to do.

I would rather predefine `KERNEL_PARAM_OPS_FL_NOARG` in the trait
implementation like C does. We would set the flag for `bool` but not for
integer types. For custom implementations of the trait, the developer
can do whatever they want.

We can create he issue if this series is accepted without the feature.

Some more confusion maybe. When I wrote "drop the default value", I
meant remove it from the code, not specify it. I take it back though. We
would use the value given in the `module!` macro `default` field as
`default_inactive`. `default_active` is not required for integer types,
since they always require a value for the argument.

But the drop would happen in `set_param` when the return value of
`core::ptr::replace` is dropped.

I do not think it is a good idea to be able to override the value
assigned to a parameter when it is given without a value. The more
predictable a user interface is, the better.

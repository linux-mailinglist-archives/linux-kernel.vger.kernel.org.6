I'm not clear, is your point that when we get regression reports on
the tool like this and Mark says things to me face-to-face at LPC we
should ignore the issue and wait for the driver fix? The PMU driver
for Apple M has fixed the legacy defaults for instructions and cycles,
great - this was the obvious fix for a driver issue from the get go.
Has it fixed all legacy values? Are you saying we should flip from
sysfs/json preferred over legacy to legacy preferred over sysfs json?
I still would like to get rid of legacy events having different wild
card behavior, cpu-cycles (legacy - matches only core PMUs) vs
cpu_cycles (sysfs - matches on all PMUs) but if we need to carry this
awkwardness for the sake of arm_dsu then *sigh* ok, it'll be forever a
potential trap when writing metrics - beware magic legacy names that
won't work on anything other than core PMUs. We carry lots of other
discrepancies around for things like arbitrary hex cut off values to
work around PMU suffix naming (5fabcdef vs a53 - both hex suffixes
with different interpretations), hotplug handling, etc. One concern
that's been raised is other tools being able to work correctly, given
the minefield set up in this regard I can imagine legacy events
working but little else. At least we can work to have the reference
implementation that comes with the kernel working.

Thanks,
Ian

Android's a bit interesting because there isn't really a "binary" in
the usual sense. an Android app is basically a shared library of JNI
code dlopen()ed into a clone() of an already-initialized Java runtime
(the "zygote").

that said, i'm not expecting sealing the vdso to be problematic (even
if i'm not sure how useful it is to do so, being unaware of any
exploit that's ever used this?).

for me the tricky part is when it's used for regular user shared
libraries which seems the most convincing use case to me, albeit
mainly for app compat reasons ["stopping apps from poking at
implementation details they shouldn't, which later causes breakage if
the implementation detail changes"]. the irony being that it'll
_cause_ app compat problems by breaking all such things all at once.
so that'll be "fun" for someone to try to roll out!

it also breaks dlclose() (unless your dlopen() was with RTLD_NODELETE,
which is not the default on Android either). that's fine for OS
libraries that have already been loaded by the zygote, but hard to
make a default. that said, i do expect games and banking apps to be
interested to try this when they hear about it.

anyway, in general i think an ELF property per-library sounds
reasonable, matching what we have for arm64 BTI. i have no strong
opinion on the system mappings and what if anything executables should
do, for the reasons given above, but the elf property sounds
reasonable.

Here are more results with recent 6.12 code, and also using SCHED_BATCH.
The control tests were run anew on Ubuntu 22.04 with the current pre-built
kernels 6.5 (baseline) and 6.8 (regression out of the box).

When updating mysql from 8.0.30 to 8.4.2, the regression grew even larger.
Disabling PLACE_LAG and RUN _TO_PARITY improved the results more than
using SCHED_BATCH.

Kernel   | default  | NO_PLACE_LAG and | SCHED_BATCH | mysql
         | config   | NO_RUN_TO_PARITY |             | version
---------+----------+------------------+-------------+---------
6.8      | -15.3%   |                  |             | 8.0.30
6.12-rc7 | -11.4%   | -9.2%            | -11.6%      | 8.0.30
         |          |                  |             |
6.8      | -18.1%   |                  |             | 8.4.2
6.12-rc7 | -14.0%   | -10.2%           | -12.7%      | 8.4.2
---------+----------+------------------+-------------+---------

Confidence intervals for all tests are smaller than +/- 0.5%.

I expect to have the repro package ready by the end of the week. Thank you
for your collective patience and efforts to confirm these results.

Completely agree that the best performance is obtained when the tasks are
individually tuned to the scheduler and explicitly set running parameters.
This isn't different from before.

But shouldn't our gold standard for default performance be CFS? There is a
significant regression out of the box when using EEVDF; how is seeking
additional tuning just to recover the lost performance not a workaround?

(Not to mention that this additional tuning means shifting the burden on
many users who may not be familiar enough with scheduler functionality.
We're essentially asking everyone to spend considerable effort to maintain
status quo from kernel 6.5.)

Thank you for confirming the regression. I've been monitoring performance
on the v6.12-rcX tags since this thread started, and the results have been
largely constant.

I've also tested other benchmarks to verify whether (1) the regression
exists and (2) the patch proposed in this thread negatively affects them.
On postgresql and wordpress/nginx there is a regression which is improved
when applying the patch; on mongo and mariadb no regression manifested, and
the patch did not make their performance worse.

This is the approach I used as well to get the results above.

Did you have a chance to run with this scenario?

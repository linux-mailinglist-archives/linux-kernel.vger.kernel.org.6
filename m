Bank selection followed by indexed read/write, inherently requires mutual
exclusion (ensuring that both these steps executed together) in order to
prevent read/write into wrong registers. That being said, HW breakpoints
get used in multiple different places such as perf, ptrace, debug monitor
based single stepping etc calling platform functions which operate on the
HW breakpoint registers here.

preempt_disable()/enable() sequence in the very last leaf level helpers
such as [read|write]_wb_reg(), will ensure required mutual exclusion.

Planning to add a comment - something like this both for read and write
helpers.
       /*
        * Bank selection in MDSELR_EL1, followed by indexed read from
        * [break|watch]point registers cannot be interrupted, as that
        * might cause misread from wrong targets. Hence this requires

        */

But regarding adding assertions, could you give some more details and
it will be great to have some relevant examples as well.

If perf is the only user, watchpoint_handler() will not get triggered
without watchpoints being installed via arch_install_hw_breakpoint().
Similarly once they get uninstalled via arch_uninstall_hw_breakpoint()
there will not be active watchpoints to trigger the handler. Although
there are other users (ptrace, debug monitor etc) besides perf which
could also be active simultaneously and race with each other ? TBH, I
am not sure.

I have not tested the concurrency aspects of the HW breakpoints enough
to be able to answer that question. But if there is a particular concern
here, happy to look into that.

But wondering how does this new bank indexed read/write mechanism (after
taking care of the mutual exclusion in the leaf level helpers such as
[read| write]_wb_reg()) still makes the existing concurrency situation
worse off than earlier ?

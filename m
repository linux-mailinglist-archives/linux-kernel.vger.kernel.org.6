It would be nice if these patches could land as they remove quite a
bit of code and complexity. To recap:

1) there are initial patches trying to renaming dwarfy things to libdw
things to be more intention revealing. There was some initial concern
wrt PERF_HAVE_DWARF_REGS and so the series has now removed that
variable as explained next. I believe landing the first part of the
patches was agreed upon as okay (Masami/Namhyung).

2) PERF_HAVE_DWARF_REGS indicated the presence of dwarf-regs.c in the
arch directory. dwarf-regs.c provided upto 3 functions:

2.1) regs_query_register_offset would translate a register name into a
pt_regs offset and was used by BPF prologues. BPF prologues existed
for BPF events and support for these was removed many releases ago.
This code was dead and could be removed.

2.2) get_arch_regstr duplicated get_dwarf_regstr and so it could be
removed as Masami agreed:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20241007171942.e96d5c520e065bbe4cf8ae5f@kernel=
.org/
The case for csky was a little more complicated as the ABI controlled
the string. The callers of get_dwarf_regstr were updated to also pass
the ELF flags so that on csky the appropriate table could be used. As
the argument is only used on csky this a no-op for everything else.

2.3) get_arch_regnum translated a register name back to a dwarf number
and only existed on x86 where "al", "ax", "eax" and "rax" could all
mean register 0. This code was moved to util with similar
machine/flags logic to get_arch_regstr and for consistency with it.

2.2 and 2.3 required the wiring through of the ELF machine and flags
in callers to get_dwarf_regstr and get_dwarf_regnum. When these values
weren't dependent on an ELF file a new EM_HOST and EF_HOST were added
to give the host ELF machine and flags. These 2 #defines got rid of
the existing separate arch files and #ifdefs.

So what's changed? On most architectures we're now passing ELF flags
to get_dwarf_regstr/regnum but these are unused unless we're on csky.
There's the get_dwarf_regstr simplification in 2.2, but I think we're
agreed that's fine. For 2.3 most of the concern seemed to be whether
we should put it in the arch directory or util, I prefer util so that
cross-platform perf.data recording/reporting is supported. Other than
this there was a call for demonstrating what happens with the wiring
up the cross-platform ELF machine/flags. To some extent this worked
before this series, this series really just fixes the plumbing so it
will work in more EM_NONE machine type cases, etc. Fixing
cross-platform isn't the intent of the series, cleaning up the code
base is, so I don't think this should gate landing the work. The code
is all well tested on the normal non-cross-platform case.

Removing 21 files, 703 lines of code and making the build variables
and defines more intention revealing feels like progress, so I'd like
for this to land.

Thanks,
Ian

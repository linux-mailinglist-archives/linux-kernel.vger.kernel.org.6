I couldn't find the thread, but I remember fairly recently it was 
mentioned that RISC-V would be supporting the legacy events after all, 
maybe it was a comment from Atish? I'm not sure if that changes the 
requirements for this or not?

I still can't really imagine how tooling would work if every tool has to 
maintain the mappings of basic events like instructions and branches. 
For example all the perf_event_open tests in ltp use the legacy events.

And wouldn't porting existing software to RISC-V would be an issue if it 
doesn't behave in a similar way to what's there already?

Yep I can check this on Monday.

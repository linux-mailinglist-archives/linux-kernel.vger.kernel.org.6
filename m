I agree that this shouldn't be hard to finish. The IS_ENABLED()
check is not that easy to do as I think we need to keep calling
inb()/outb() outside of an #ifdef a compile-time error.

However, I think most of the inb/outb usage in 8250_pci.c can
just be converted to either serial_port_in()/serial_port_out(),
using the 8250 specific wrappers, or to ioread8()/iowrite8()
in combination with pci_iomap().

It might help to add a UPIO_IOMAP type to replace UPIO_PORT
for the PCI drivers and just use pci_iomap() exclusively in that
driver.

Part of the problem that Niklas is trying to solve with the
CONFIG_HAS_IOPORT annotations is to prevent an invalid inb()/outb()
from turning into a NULL pointer dereference as it currently does
on architectures that have no way to support PIO but get the
default implementation from asm-generic/io.h.

It's not clear if having a silently non-working driver or one
that crashes makes it easier to debug for users. Having a clear
warning message in the PCI probe code is probably the best
we can hope for.

I think that anyone using hardware that relies on port I/O on
non-x86 is at this point going to have a reasonable understanding
of the system, so I'm not too worried here. ;-)

Right.

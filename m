The ABI requirements are certainly unclear, but people get *very* upset
when behaviour changes, so I think we need to have some certainty that
we're not backing ourselves into a corner where we have to make
substantial behavioural changes later.

Surely we can figure out how this works on other architectures today?

There's a substantial argument for aligning with x86, so can we figure
out under which conditions x86 would provide guest samples? e.g. is that
always, never, or when certain attr options are configured?

If we're liable to need perf tool changes, then we *definitely* need to
understand this better.

That depends entirely on what changes we'd expect would be necessary in
the perf tools. We need to be certain that we don't enable some use case
that subseuqent changes break.

Mark.

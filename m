By default it picked "cycles:P" with this patch it now picks "<core
pmu>/cycles/P". As your Tested-by attested this does work.

I'm not. What your saying is that the arm_dsu_0 PMU advertising cycles
doesn't work if you use it for perf record. I agree. This change fixed
the issue. What to do if someone writes "perf record -e cycles" well
there are two advertised cycles events isn't it reasonable perf record
try to open them both?

It's not about perf record having some kind of intelligence and
picking a PMU. perf record either opens an event on the PMU you ask
for it it wild cards across them all. For legacy events they used to
be handled differently and I'm trying to fix this. In part so I can
fix the PMU behavior on the Apple M1 and later CPUs that fail to
implement legacy events properly in their PMU driver.  You've said you
used to use Apple CPUs for ARM testing, I'm trying to fix a problem
that will help you.

Sure, I added "if user =3D=3D linus then pick wrong PMU". The code was
reviewed by IBM and Intel. ARM were on the CC list. The change baked
on linux-next for a good long while. All of this points to my problem
that I'm often fixing problems for ARM with a complete lack of
testing/reviewing/acking... by them.

But as I've pointed out it wouldn't because then you'd break the
behavior of doing things like gathering memory bandwidth from uncore
PMUs. An example:
```
$ sudo perf stat -e data_read -a sleep 1

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

          4,447.10 MiB  data_read

       1.001748581 seconds time elapsed
```
By making the wildcard only work for core PMUs the best case is you'd make =
this:
```
$ sudo perf stat -e 'imc_free_running/data_read/' -a sleep 1

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

          4,454.56 MiB  imc_free_running/data_read/

       1.001865448 seconds time elapsed
```
But that wouldn't work again as ARM decided to mess up the naming
convention, my unmerged fix for that is here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240515060114.3268149-1-irogers@google.com/
it says Marvell but Marvell followed ARM's lead.

I'm not clear what you think is "new". All the events are being picked
in your case from sysfs, the way this has all worked is years if not
decades old. What is new is that because of an event name the behavior
should be uniform, motivated initially by fixing your other ARM test
platform of Apple.

I agree it picked the wrong PMU for default events. This was a problem
on no systems that anybody was bothering to test with. Having been
made aware of the issue I fixed it in this patch, you're welcome.

What is still not clear from this is what should the behavior be of:

$ perf record -e cycles ...

Should it wildcard all events and open them on all PMUs potentially
failing? Well this has always been perf's behavior were the event:

$ perf record -e inst_retired.any ...

where inst_retired.any could be an event advertised on an accelerator
or device where sampling doesn't work. If inst_retired.any doesn't
work for you as an example, pick another event that does. A GPU has
instructions and cycles so the likelihood of naming conflicts is high.

We can make perf record ignore opening events on PMUs that don't
support sampling, it's an invasive and non-trivial change not suited
to landing in 6.10. It is also a behavior change, see this thread for
how popular those are.

So 6.10 is now in a mess. We likely fail tests, reverting this change
has a bunch of consequences and presumably I'm expected to dig
through, figure those out and then provide fixes. Thanks!

For 6.11 I currently suggest we revert the revert and apply this
patch. This would also I think be the best thing to do for 6.10. I
appreciate my opinions are worth much less than others. I don't see
why the priority should be to fix things on an ARM system that nobody
is actively testing on rather than say Apple devices fixed by the
reverted change, RISC-V system, etc. Anyway...

Thanks,
Ian

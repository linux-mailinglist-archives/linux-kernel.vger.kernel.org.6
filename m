Thanks Kan. I'm not wondering about a case of 2 CPUs, say on CPU0 and
solely its perf event context, I want to know its core power and
package power as a group so I never record one without the other. That
grouping wouldn't be possible with 2 PMUs.

Agreed. Here I'm thinking about the bugs I see in PMUs. One of them is
to always succeed in opening siblings within a group and for the
unavailable counters to just report "not counted". This breaks weak
groups used by metrics.

I agree without cpumask means all CPUs, the bug I see on ARM PMUs is
that they have uncore PMUs with no or empty cpumasks leading to the
uncore events being programmed on every CPU and over counting,
multiplexing counters and so on. I'm trying to devise tests so that
they can see they are broken.

My understanding had been that for core PMUs a "perf stat -C" option
would choose the particular CPU to count the event on, for an uncore
PMU the -C option would override the cpumask's "default" value. We
have code to validate this:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools-next.git/tr=
ee/tools/perf/util/evlist.c?h=3Dperf-tools-next#n2522
But it seems now that overriding an uncore PMU's default CPU is
ignored. If you did:
$ perf stat -C 1 -e data_read -a sleep 0.1
Then the tool thinks data_read is on CPU1 and will set its thread
affinity to CPU1 to avoid IPIs. It seems to fix this we need to just
throw away the -C option.

Cool. Let me know if you can think of more.

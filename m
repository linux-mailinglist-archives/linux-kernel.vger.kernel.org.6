Great, I'll mark the cve as having that as the "vulnerable" commit id,
and then re-run the scripts and update the .json file and push it to
cve.org when I get back to a better network connection.

Yes, it depeneds on the commit that fixes the issue, and the mail
message for the CVE record says:

	The file(s) affected by this issue are:
		drivers/firmware/arm_scmi/reset.c

Note that we can not include this in the json record format because,
while cve has a field for this, it does not actually work properly for
file names (it wants a url for a filename, strange but true...)  This is
a bug on the cve.org end and hopefully will be fixed one day so that we
can provide the file name information in a machine-parsable format.

Wonderful, thanks!

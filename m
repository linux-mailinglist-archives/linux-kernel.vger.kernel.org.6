Hi Alejandro + Huang, Ying

This seems to be an unfortunate case of disconnected work on the same
large problem and shows the need for more coordination.
Note these are my personal responses to this, other maintainers and
community members may well disagree!

Alejandro had already clearly adopted the patches from Dan and taken a
number of them forwards as part of his patch set.  That had
happened before Huang, Ying posted the RFC (which referenced
Alejandro's work along side Dan's original series).

The idea of trying to accelerate the process of upstreaming type 2
support by merging a few low hanging fruit is certainly one I think
we can all get behind.  However, it needs some coordination to avoid
actually slowing down overall progress by both causing spread out
reviews and divergence in direction + churn in the base on which
the fuller sets are built. So Huang, Ying please work with Alejandro
rather than continuing to evolve this set independently.

Perhaps an initial step would be to figure out how to reorder Alejandro's
series so that any work duplicated by this set is pulled to the front.
That should make it easy to identify and discuss differences that
have resulted from review of this series. At that point we can focus
the review on those patches as the rest of the set continues to evolve.
However, I would  strongly suggest coordinating that work in order to
avoid churning the code when Alejandro may be near to posting a new
version of his fuller series.

Whilst the precise way we have ended up with two sets changing the same
code is unusual it is extremely common for multiple people to be working
on the same code and coordination to be needed.  Many of the regular
sync calls / discord channels / irc etc are used to figure out how
this can be done efficiently.  Please use those channels here.

If it would be useful to have an additional call or similar to ensure
a fruitful collaboration then we can set one up.

Finally I'll note that I'd have expected to see explicit discussion of
how this series relates to Alejandro's set and a suggestion of how to
move forwards in the cover letter and that would perhaps have either
resolved Alejandro's concerns or at least publicly shown awareness of the
issues this would cause for his work.

Irrespective of the other reasons for such an intro text, whilst the
CXL maintainers were at least somewhat aware, we always appreciate
a reminder in a cover letter!

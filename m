If the agreement is that dma-buf-handling drivers must get reviews from
dri-devel, then let's document that in MAINTAINERS and agree with the
maintainer.

There's no need to move the driver for that.

Sounds good.

There's a small, but growing userbase of the current upstream fastrpc
uAPI. If there are benefits and a migration path, I think it's
reasonable to explore that - at this point, but probably not much later.

Certainly sounds reasonable to avoid adding new accel-drivers in
drivers/misc.

Please someone correct me if I am wrong.

Consider this; you are collapsing a 256K folio. => #PTEs = 256K/4K = 64 
=> #chunks = 64 / 8 = 8.

Let the PTE state within the chunks be as follows:

Chunk 0: < 5 filled   Chunk 1: 5 filled   Chunk 2: 5 filled   Chunk 3: 5 
filled

Chunk 4: 5 filled   Chunk 5: < 5 filled   Chunk 6: < 5 filled   Chunk 7: 
< 5 filled

Consider max_ptes_none = 40% (512 * 40 / 100 = 204.8 (round down) = 204 
< HPAGE_PMD_NR/2).
=> To collapse we need at least 60% of the PTEs filled.

Your algorithm marks chunks in the bitmap if 60% of the chunk is filled. 
Then, if the number of chunks set is greater than 60%, then we will 
collapse.

Chunk 0 will be marked zero because less than 5 PTEs are filled => 
percentage filled <= 50%

Right now the state is
0111 1000
where the indices are the chunk numbers.
Since #1s = 4 => percent filled = 4/8 * 100 = 50%, 256K folio collapse 
won't happen.

For the first 4 chunks, the percent filled is 75%.  So the state becomes
1111 1000
after 128K collapse, and now 256K collapse will happen.

Either I got this correct, or I do not understand the utility of 
maintaining chunks :) What you are doing is what I am doing except that 
my chunk size = 1.

Not sure what you mean here - the EFI table that gets clobbered by
kexec *is* the table that is created by the stub loader to pass the
TPM log to the kernel. Not sure what alternative you have in mind
here.

No. The problem is that the size of the table is *in* the table, and
so if it gets corrupted, the code that attempts to memblock_reserve()
it goes off into the weeds. But that does not imply there is a point
to having access to this table from a kexec kernel in the first place.

kexec as a bootloader under TPM based measured boot will need to do a
lot more than pass the firmware's event log to the next kernel. I'd
expect a properly engineered kexec to replace this table entirely, and
include the hashes of the assets it has loaded and measured into the
respective PCRs.

But let's stick to solving the actual issue here, rather than
philosophize on how kexec might work in this context.

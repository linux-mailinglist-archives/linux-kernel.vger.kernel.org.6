No it does not at all.  Not even close.  Don't be confused, it's totally
different and again, something I consider as blackmail.

Again, no, security@k.o does not work with linux-distros at all, we have
different rules and timelines that do not work together.

Only after security@k.o has fixed something then could someone possibly
contact linux-distros if they really want to.  But that's on them, and
again, keep the two workflows totally separate.

Also realize that linux-distros is not needed to get fixes out to the
distros for the kernel, they should be taking the normal stream of fixes
we provide in the stable releases at a weekly basis.

Again, no, keep the two groups separate, they do not work combined in
any way.

CVEs are also totally separate from all of this, it's not an issue that
you probably even need to add here at all as why are they needed here?

Again, they are separate, just point at our existing documentation for
kernel.org, as we always keep that up to date.  Why even point at
oss-security, as that's not something that normally is used for kernel
issues otherwise it would just be a constant stream of patches sent
there (i.e. our normal mailing lists.)

Just point at our existing documentation please.  That should be all
that is needed.

thanks,

I will run some tests during the weekend and get back with results later.

I agree, it is probably more related to marketing, licensing and/or
what is tested.

Vendor U-Boot apply following logic/policy for rk3582 (and rk3583).

RK3582 policy:
- always remove gpu
- always remove both rkvdec cores
- remove bad rkvenc core, if both are normal, remove rkvenc1 anyway

RK3583 policy:
- always keep gpu
- remove bad rkvdec core, if both are normal, remove rkvdec1 anyway
- remove bad rkvenc core, if both are normal, remove rkvenc1 anyway

CPU core policy:
- remove both cores within a cluster having a bad core
- if core4~7 are all normal, remove core6 and core7 anyway

Jonas

I totally agree with this. The issue is that nothing says that the
abort is in any way related to userspace.

But we don't know for sure what caused this conflict by the time we
arrive in the handler. It could equally be because we have a glaring
bug somewhere on the kernel side, even if you are *now* only concerned
with userspace.

If anything, this should absolutely check for FAR_EL1 and assert that
this is indeed caused by such change.

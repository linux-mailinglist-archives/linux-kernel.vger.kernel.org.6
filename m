There might be something to the arbitrary number of periods, because for 
a very short run you might want a high sample rate and for a long run 
you would want a low rate. BPF might allow you to reduce the rate over 
time so you don't have to worry about picking the right one so much.

+Leo because I think he's looking at linking BPF to the aux pause/resume 
patches [1] which could be similar.

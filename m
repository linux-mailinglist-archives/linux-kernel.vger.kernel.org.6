Thanks! I write an issue based on this to my Codeberg repository, and
purge it once the time. I'll start by that and later on formalize
some commits or perhaps IMA specific buildroot config...

As far as the patch goes, I thought that I refine the patch myself, and
save everyone's time and nervers from unnecessary reviews rounds. It
does not make any radical changes to the approach.

See https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/20241107004708.108667-1-jarkko@=
kernel.org/

I cannot take reviewed/tested-by's from any of the authors but if you
can check that it works for you I can surely send it Linus without
further tags than three SOB's :-) That said happy to get at least
tested-by from someone.

I'll send a PR to Linus as soon as possible.

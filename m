They aren't required for each HB.  You could have multiple host bridge and one CFMWS
as long as you have decided to only support interleave.
I would only expect to see this where the bios is instantiating CFMWS
entries to match a specific locked down config though.

Don't forget the fun of CFMWS covering multiple SRAT entries (I think
we just go with the first one?)

I wouldn't go with naturally for the reason below.  It happens, but maybe
not natural :)

Not just devices, also topologies.  Could well have switches below some
ports and direct connected devices on others.

If the bios is friendly you should be able to map that to a different
CFMWS, but sure what bios is that nice?

So we pick the "legacy" one, as always, and the one that is in a PMU
needs to have its pmu name specified, no?

Right, the support for hybrid systems brought lots of problems, most
people didn't have access to such systems and thus couldn't test
patches, so the attempt was to keep the existing code working as it had
been while allowing for the support for the new hybrid systems.

As more people get access to hybrid systems we started noticing problems
and working on fixing it, you did a lot of work in this area, highly
appreciated.

Without access to such systems, yes, see above.

Yes, and if somebody wants to profile in just one of those core types,
just specify the "cpu_atom" or "cpu_core" to have it fully specified.

I saw them saying that supporting PERF_TYPE_HARDWARE counters was ok as
they didn't want to break the perf tooling workflow, no?

Ok, but the desire for consistency clashes with how things have been for
a long time, tools expect, scripts, etc, so we seem to need the special
case for what has been called in these threads "legacy events".

In verbose mode, IIRC. If the user wants some "cycles" event and it is
not included in the tool output then, as with other cases, using -v to
see if some extra debug message can clarify seems the usual workflow.

Do you have a link to this thread?

I think that is fair to say, to try and make the events that most people
use as they worked in the past, i.e. no surprise for people not
interested in metrics, hybrid systems, and lots of other features in
perf that most people seldomly, if at all, use.

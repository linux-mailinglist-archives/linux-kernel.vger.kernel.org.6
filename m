Each VM is configured with 8 vcpus and 16G memory. The number of
physical CPUs is 320.

Thanks, I will try it.

When a vcpu is moved to a different CPU, of course VMOVP has to be sent.
I mean is it possible to call its_vpe_set_affinity() to send VMOVP by
other means (instead of by calling the irq_set_affinity() API). So we
can bypass this tmp_mask_lock.

Thanks for the explanation. The key to the problem is not vcpu migration
between CPUs. The key point is that many vcpus execute vgic_v4_load() at
the same time. Even if it is not migrated to another CPU, there may be a
large number of vcpus executing vgic_v4_load() at the same time. For
example, the service running in VMs has a large number of MMIO accesses
and need to return to userspace for emulation. Due to the competition of
tmp_mask_lock, performance will deteriorate.

When the target CPU is the same CPU as the last run, there seems to be
no need to call irq_set_affinity() in this case. I did a test and it was
indeed able to alleviate the problem described above.

I feel it might be better to remove tmp_mask_lock or call
its_vpe_set_affinity() in another way. So I mentioned these two ideas
above.

Thanks,
Kunkun Jiang

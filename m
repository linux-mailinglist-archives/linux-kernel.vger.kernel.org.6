Hi,

Thanks for working on this!

I'm sorry, I should have wrote minutes on the discussion we had with TJ
and Tvrtko the other day.

We're all very interested in making this happen, but doing a "DRM"
cgroup doesn't look like the right path to us.

Indeed, we have a significant number of drivers that won't have a
dedicated memory but will depend on DMA allocations one way or the
other, and those pools are shared between multiple frameworks (DRM,
V4L2, DMA-Buf Heaps, at least).

This was also pointed out by Sima some time ago here:
https://lore.kernel.org/amd-gfx/YCVOl8%2F87bqRSQei@phenom.ffwll.local/

So we'll want that cgroup subsystem to be cross-framework. We settled on
a "device" cgroup during the discussion, but I'm sure we'll have plenty
of bikeshedding.

The other thing we agreed on, based on the feedback TJ got on the last
iterations of his series was to go for memcg for drivers not using DMA
allocations.

It's the part where I expect some discussion there too :)

So we went back to a previous version of TJ's work, and I've started to
work on:

  - Integration of the cgroup in the GEM DMA and GEM VRAM helpers (this
    works on tidss right now)

  - Integration of all heaps into that cgroup but the system one
    (working on this at the moment)

  - Integration into v4l2 (next on my list)

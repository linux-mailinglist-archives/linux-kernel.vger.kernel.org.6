Yeah, the dummy ops were a nice idea at the time, but have been looking 
increasingly anachronistic for a while - in fact I think they're 
effectively broken already now, since if arm64 stops selecting DMA_OPS 
via IOMMU_DMA then the set_dma_ops() in the ACPI path isn't going to be 
effective anyway.

I certainly don't hate the idea of using bus_dma_limit as the next most 
functionally robust way to deny DMA for now. It would probably be a bit 
awkward to upheave the existing notion of 0 meaning no limit, but 
setting it to 1 would have the desired effect in practice (at least with 
dma-direct), plus would look nicely deliberate - for completeness we'd 
probably just want an extra check or two in the right place(s) to ensure 
that such a DMA-denied device still can't end up being given ops other 
than dma-direct, but that seems simple enough.

Thanks,
Robin.

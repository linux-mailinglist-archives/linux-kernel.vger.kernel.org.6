If you have some more ideas on how to make this more generic and
less SNC specific I'm all ears.

My goal is to be more clear next version.

I can add some more comments to make this more obvious.

I'm going to keep this the same then. The "rmdir" call path doesn't have
any open files to plumb down to this function.

Yes. The metadata is the display_id for files that need to sum across
SNC nodes, but the domain id for ones where no summation is needed.

If you don't trust the device then I wouldn't think it actually matters 
what happens at this level - the higher-level driver is already going to 
have to carefully check and sanitise whatever data it reads back from 
the buffer before consuming it, at which point reading a torn value due 
to a race would be essentially indistinguishable from if the device had 
gone wrong and simply written that nonsense value itself.

I think the more significant case is when polling for the device to 
write back some kind of status word, where in C code the driver would 
use READ_ONCE() to ensure a single-copy-atomic read of the same size the 
device is going to write - sticking a regular memcpy() into the middle 
of that can't necessarily be trusted to work correctly (even if it may 
appear to 99% of the time).

Thanks,
Robin.

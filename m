FWIW, I'd generally prefer to do that since it avoids a number of
horrible edge-cases and gets rid of the need to do SW filtering, which
falls somewhere between "tricky" and "not entirely possible". However,
that's not what LBR and others do, which is why we went with filter
merging.

If folk on the tools side are happy with the kernel rejecting
conflicting events, then I'd be more than happy to do that. What I don't
want is that we start off with that approach and people immediately
start to complain that the BRBE driver rejects events that the LBR
driver accepts.

See the last time this came up:

Yes, there is a mismatch between the hardware and the perf ABI.

Do you mean if the perf tool ensured that all events in a given session
had the same filter? From the kernel's PoV there's no such thing as a
"perf session", and I'm not sure whether you're suggesting doing that in
userspace or withing the kernel.

Doing that in the perf tool would certianly make a stronger argument for
the kernel taking the "reject conflicting branch filters" option.

Doing that within the kernel isn't really possible.

From the kernel's PoV there is no such thing as a perf session, and the
branch filters are per-event per the perf ABI.

We only really have two options:

(1) Reject conflicting filters when scheduling events. At event open
    time we have ot check whether an entire group is actually
    schedulable.

(2) Merge filters when scheduling events, and then filter out
    branches which don't match a particular event's filters when reading
    the branches.

I cannot parse this question. What are you trying to suggest here?

Just to be clear, you're talking about userspace specifically, right?

There are users that want a contiguous set of branches, which is what
hardware tries to guarantee, and that's what LBR tries to gaurantee
today, so I don't think that we can say gaps are always fine.

If we want a "give me as many arbitrary samples branches as possible,
with arbitrary potential gaps" option, I'm not necessarily opposed to
that, but I do not think that should be the default behaviour.

Yes, and I was initially concerned about that, but is that really a
problem? So long as the event period doesn't *always* coincide with
preemption you'll get records from other samples anyway.

While I agree this is a theoretical concern, I don't think its of
practical importance. This discarding happens on x86 *today* with LBR,
and (AFAICT) there hav been no complaints. Note that the LBR logic to
save/restore records for task contexts is only done for user callstack
recording, which BRBE does not support.

Regardless, there's still the problematic interaction with event
rotation; you cannot save/restore the records safely here if events (and
the relevant filters) can change between the save and restore.

Discarding here is significantly simpler, and correct.

Mark.

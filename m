To me, this pointer arithmetic is just a bug. Anyone in his right mind
would write:

        typeof(*s->fam) *element =3D s->fam;

When I compare your example to my example, I think that both are
convoluted and unrealistic but with the *huge* difference that:

 - in my example, the code logic is correct and the thing breaks
   because of the current overestimation in struct_size(). See the
   clang documentation:

      https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#counted-by

    The clang guys are using the same calculation as in my patch. So I
    can think of a world in which someone with good intent would copy
    this example, and then (for example because of a collaborative
    work), someone else would use the struct_size() to do a copy or a
    memset resulting in an out of bound as illustrated  in my example.

 - in your example, the code is incorrect. If we start to apply that
   "what if users do random pointer arithmetic" reasoning, then
   anything can be proven to be a security risk.

To repeat, I think that my example was convoluted, but I see yours as
even more convoluted.

So, with this said, what do you think is the good trade-off? Return
the exact size so that code with correct logic works as intended or
keep the extra bytes in case someone does some crazy pointer
arithmetic?

How does a struct with "multiple trailing flexible arrays" look like? By
the C standard, structures can only have one single fam, so this isn't
something I am aware of.

Would the struct_size() macro still be relevant for those "multiple
fam" structures or would the structure size also be hand calculated?
Isn't this argument out of scope of this patch discussion?

So far, I think that my example is more concrete than your pointer
arithmetic argument. Not by a lot, and this is why I just put that
security argument at the end after the --- cutter.


Yours sincerely,
Vincent Mailhol

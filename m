I think it's similar to case we discussed [1] in v11
on why not good idea to use writeq on 32bit regs.
So some corner cases for unaligned 32b addresses might get truncated.

We would need to audit on all the smmu-v2 based devices using a6xx
version before I can comment on this, but mostly it should be in the 
same generation of snapdragon (scxx/smxx).

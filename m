Hi,

Sorry I missed this thread. Thanks for your comments.

OK, let me try to update to handle module loading. I also need to add
a module which has a test tracepoint in init function.

See trace_kprobe_module_callback()@kernel/trace/trace_kprobe.c. I think
we can filter the MODULE_STATE_COMING flag before locking event_mutex.
We anyway don't check the module is going because it would be a waste to
disarm the raw tracepoint events from the going module.

Is that because perf uses per task buffers? Will perf know this if it
uses a global buffer? What does perf do with "-a"?

That would put a huge burden on those tracers. Specifically ftrace.
Just because perf doesn't need it, it doesn't mean it can't be part of
the infrastructure. The cookie isn't even per-cpu. The counter is just
generated per cpu to avoid races. The cookie will have the CPU as part
of the bits, plus the per-cpu counter. This will give us a unique value
across all CPUs without having to do any atomic operations. It's just
that the cookie must be unique for every time a task enters the kernel,
and stay the same while it is in the kernel.

So if the task enters the kernel on CPU 1 and a trace is requested, the
tracer still needs to save that event when the request occurred (for
example, the kernel stack trace). It needs a unique identifier that
will be attached to the user stack trace when it is made, so that post
processing can tell where to append that stack.

Then the task can migrate to several other CPUs, but it will still have
the same cookie as when it received it on the first CPU. The cookie
only gets updated on the task when it goes back to user space.

ftrace allows for several instances that could be filtering on the same
or different tasks. One instance could filter 3 tasks, another 2 tasks,
where one of those tasks is in both instance. The user stack
infrastructure should give a way to easily map the request to the stack
via some kind of identifier.

What would perf do on dropped events? Say a system call happened, perf
requested a user stack trace, then the events were dropped, and when it
started again, it was in a system call, how would perf know it is in
the same system call? I guess the callback when the dropped user stack
trace occurred would tell perf to reset. Still it adds a pretty big
burden for the tracers to handle these corner cases whereas a simple
identifier is much more simple and robust.

The cstate PMUs already do so, e.g., cstate_core, cstate_pkg.

From another perspective, it discloses the scope information in a PMU
name. If a user only cares about the information of a package, they just
need to focus on everything under <pmu>_pkg. Otherwise, they have to go
through all the events.

No, it's not allowed for the RAPL counters.

If the motivation is to find another way to group counters with
different scope, it may not work.

We once tried to mix the perf_invalid_context PMUs in a group. But it's
denied.

The event.cpus still faces the same issues.

Yes, there are some cleanup opportunities for the cpumask/hotplug codes.

We may even abstracts some generic interfaces for pkg or core level PMUs.

Eventually, the complexity/duplication should be able to be reduced.

Not just the cpumask but also migrate the context for some PMUs, see
perf_pmu_migrate_context().

It seems we really need a shared cpumask in the generic code, so the
drivers don't need to handle the hotplug everywhere. I will think about it.

It just looked like after James gave some expert input the
conversation got stuck, so I am just trying to move it along.

I don't think anyone knows what this whole elephant looks like,
which makes solving the problem tricky.

I am fine with not inventing a new mechanism, but I think we need
to reuse whatever mechanism the stub loader uses to pass it's
table to the kernel.  Not the EFI table that disappears at
ExitBootServices().

Someone seems to think so or there would not be a complaint that it is
getting corrupted.

This should not be the kexec-on-panic kernel as that runs in memory
that is reserved solely for it's own use.  So we are talking something
like using kexec as a bootloader.

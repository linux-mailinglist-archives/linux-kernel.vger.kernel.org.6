For the case 1, the userspace can reject it as it has sufficient info to
detect mismatched filters by iterating event list.

This rejects the case 2 in the PMU driver.

Can I understand "independent events" are events that are not in a event
group?

If independent events can have mismatched filters, the PMU driver can
activate them simultaneously, this means the BRBE driver needs to merge
the branch filters.  If so, I still see the complexity caused by this
case.

If so, the perf tool will miss info for checking the existed branch
filter and defer to handle the mismatched filter error until the
kernel reports the issue.

Sorry for that.  After your reminder, I understood that the PMU driver
has no knowledge for perf session.

The description above does not refer to perf session.  As you said, the
PMU driver has its own context to track active events, and it is
possible that some active events might trace only user mode while others
trace only kernel mode.  In this case, BRBE needs to be enabled for both
user and kernel modes.  When capturing samples, the BRBE driver needs to
filter out branch records based on a specific event for its
corresponding mode.

For better understanding, though we don't allow mismatched filters, I
still think we should set both E0BRE and ExBRE bits if there are
multiple active events with different modes.

I mean, in Linux perf, we can add code to check branch filters for
opened events when creating a session and report an error for
mismatching filters.  I would suggest we implement it specifically
for Arm64 to avoid dispute with other archs.

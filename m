Hi Eric,

Thanks for chiming in.

This shouldn't be necessary, and I think it is actively harmful to
keep inventing special ways for the kexec kernel to learn about these
things that deviate from the methods used by the first kernel. This is
how we ended up with 5 sources of truth for the physical memory map
(EFI memory map, memblock and 3 different versions of the e820 memory
map).

We should try very hard to make kexec idempotent, and reuse the
existing methods where possible. In this case, the EFI configuration
table is already being exposed to the kexec kernel, which describes
the base of the allocation. The size of the allocation can be derived
from the table header.

The TPM log is a table created by the EFI stub loader, which is part
of the kernel. So if we need to tweak this for kexec's benefit, I'd
prefer changing it in a way that can accommodate the first kernel too.
However, I think the current method already has that property so I
don't think we need to do anything (modulo fixing the bug)

That said, I am doubtful that the kexec kernel can make meaningful use
of the TPM log to begin with, given that the TPM will be out of sync
at this point. But it is still better to keep it for symmetry, letting
the higher level kexec/kdump logic running in user space reason about
whether the TPM log has any value to it.

There are quite a lot of options regarding the implementation of an in-SoC
RNG. Many of them rely on external components, such as a resistor or simply
a pin left floating. Others may be influenced by the power delivery setup.
Or rely on "thermal noise generated from inherently random quantum mechanic=
al
properties of silicon" (Intel).

I don't know which design Rockchip chose, but just because the RNG is
inside the SoC I wouldn't exclude the option that the quality it
delivers may depend also on external components on the board, or even
the dielectric properties of the board material itself, or (in case of
bad designs) environmental circumstances such as the amount of
electromagnetic noise around, and that then again depends on relative
humidity, exposure to sunlight, ... The latter would be really bad, of
course, because then we would have some kind of hidden sensor rather
than a RNG, but nothing is too stupid to not show up when engineers of
proprietary technologies are left alone.

So imho only empirical data can tell.

+1 Will do.

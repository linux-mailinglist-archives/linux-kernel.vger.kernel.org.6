Hmm... I see, the problem is deeper that I thought.

Yeah, I guess that would work.  I'll need to add a new field to flag the
'next commit' in struct ext4_inode_info.  I'll need to play a bit with it
and see what I can came up with.  Thanks for the suggestion.

Right, I saw his patchset only after sending my RFC (and I should have
probably included him on the CC as well; probably get_maintainer.pl isn't
picking his email).

I'll need to look at those changes too, which will probably take me some
time as most of that code isn't familiar to me.

Thanks a lot for your review, Jan.  Much appreciated.

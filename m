Okay, looking into coding this up then.

Do you have a method for obtaining these stats?

Last time I used eBPF + bpftrace to extract these stats.  The high rate
these updates occur, it caused production overload situations that SRE
noticed.  So, I have to be careful when producing these stats for you.

Also could you be more specific what code lines you want stats for?

The situation we have *today* with a global IRQ-disabling spin_lock is
precisely causing a priority-inversion situation always by design.
Userspace applications (reading stat file) and kswapd background
processes are currently getting higher priority than both hardware and
software interrupts. This is causing actual production issues, which is
why I'm working on this.

I do understand that changing this to a global mutex creates the
theoretical *possibility* for priority-inversion between processes with
different configured priorities.  IMHO this is better than always taking
the "big" bottom-half-lock [LWN].  I still want to lower the potential
priority-inversion issue with the mutex lock, by (1) working on lowering
the pressure on the lock (e.g. exit if flush is ongoing on root, and
e.g. add time limit on how often flush can run on sub-trees), and (2) we
will collect production metrics for lock contention and hold time (with
appropriate alerts).

I proposed a fixed 50 ms flush rate limiting in [2].  But I don't want
this to be a static value as it will vary on different configs and
hardware. I propose making this dynamic via measuring the time it takes
to flush the cgroup root.  This makes sense in a queuing theory context,
because this corresponds to the (longest) service time, and theory say
"a queue is formed when customers arrive faster than they can get
served". Thus, this should lower the pressure/contention on the lock,
while still allowing frequent flushing.  Hope it makes sense.

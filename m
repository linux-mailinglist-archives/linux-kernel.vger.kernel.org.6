Hijacking this thread to rant about state of firmware implementation on
this platform that gives me zero confidence in merging any of these without
examining each of the interface details in depth and at lengths.

Also I see the standard protocol like PERF seem to have so many issues which
adds to my no confidence. I can't comment on that thread for specific reasons.

I will briefly mention my suspicion here. This Lenovo ThinkPad T14s being
primarily targeting other OS using ACPI might have just implemented what is
required for ACPI CPPC which conveniently doesn't have to discover lot of
fastchannel details since they are supplied in the tables straight away.
But that also would mean it could be not fully compliant to SCMI spec.

Either we need to run some compliance test suite(which again may need more
work as it is unfortunately make platform specific - referring to [1])
or use the raw interface in the kernel and throw /dev/random at it and see
how well it can cope up.

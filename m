You can't mix in device alloc/init with device registration. As soon
as you register a device, it's available for user-space to issue
IOCTLs. So if there is any race between device init and it's usage
then it's going to cause hard to debug issues.

There can be an argument that dev_ctx being a member of "struct
tee_device" so it should get initialized alongside other bits in
tee_device_alloc() (we can rename
s/tee_device_alloc()/tee_device_init()/ if that makes it obvious). But
I can live with the device context getting initialized as the first
thing in tee_device_register() avoiding the race window mentioned
above.

Still not sure why it isn't an explicit requirement when you are
already passing an initialized ops structure to tee_device_alloc().

Yeah, arguing a committee is mostly a waste of time, also, they
typically listen a lot more when you say, here these two compilers have
implemented it and this Linux thing uses it.

So yeah, language extensions are it.

Yep, I read that a while back. I think you referenced it in one of them
other threads where we disagreed over struct_size() :-)

Yeah, not just Linux I imagine. The rules are so insane it's near
useless. I'd say press onwards with the language extension, it's not
like Linux kernel is written in ANSI/ISO C anyway :-)

WTF :-)

That macro is fairly trivial, nowhere near as ugly as struct_size() :-)
But urgh... can't we do something like:

void *memcpy_off(void *dst, const void *src, size_t off, size_t n)
{
	memcpu(dst, src+off, n);
	return dst;
}

And then you can write:

  memcpy_off(args, regs, offsetof(*regs, bx), 6);

I mean, that sucks, but possilby less than struct_group() does.

[ also, we should probably do:
  #defime offsetof(t, m) __builtin_offsetof(typeof(t), m) ]

In this case I would just make all of pt_regs a union with one giant
array (much like some archs already have IIRC).

Oh, yeah, I think I saw that fly by on hackernews a while ago.

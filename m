Hi Hans!

thanks for your feedback!

There are a fair amount of complaints on the Framework forums about this.
And that specific panel is actually readable even at 0% PWM.

Indeed, but IMO it is better to maintain the list in the kernel than
forcing all users to resort to random forum advise and fiddle with
lowlevel system configuration.

The various userspace wrappers already are applying a safety
threshold to not go to "0".
At least gnome-settings-daemon and brightnessctl do not go below 1% of
brightness_max. They already have to deal with panels that can go
completely dark.

From my experience with ThinkPads, the default brightness range there
was fine for me. But on the Framework 13 AMD it is not.

I'm not a fan. It seems much too complicated for most users.

Some more background to the Framework 13 AMD case:
The same panel on the Intel variant already goes darker.
The last responses we got from Framework didn't indicate that the high
minimum brightness was intentional [0], [1].
Coincidentally the "12" returned from ATIF matches
AMDGPU_DM_DEFAULT_MIN_BACKLIGHT, so maybe the firmware is just not set
up completely.

This also seems much too complicated for normal users.

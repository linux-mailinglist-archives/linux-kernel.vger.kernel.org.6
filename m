I agree it makes more sense to have multiple documents under dedicated
sections.  And putting page_owner sounds not that odd to me.

DAMON is, however, not a tool but a framework that helps easy development of
access-aware kernel components.  Such components could be development tools and
system operations optimizations (using DAMOS).  So, IMHO, 'development tools'
section is not the perfect place for DAMON documents.

Actually, even for allocation-profiling and page_owner, I think 'development
tools' might not be a perfect category.  I understand those as features that
could be useful for system investigations of multiple purposes.

So, in short, I think it is not easy to find a perfect cateogry...

I don't think it's a large and invasive change.  The tools are mostly
zero-initialized so we don't need to reset to NULL.  And tool->cb is
called mostly from two functions: machines__deliver_event() and
perf_session__process_user_event().  Can we change them to check
NULL and get rid of perf_tool__fill_defaults() to keep it const?

Thanks,

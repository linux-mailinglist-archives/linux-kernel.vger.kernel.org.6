Like Yosry, I don't agree that simply using ratelimited flush here is
the right solution, at-least other options need to be investigated first.

I can confirm that at Cloudflare, we are seeing massive issues due
kswapd and to this specific mem_cgroup_flush_stats() call inlined in
shrink_node, taking the rstat lock. I looked at our 12 numa node
machines, given kswapd have a kthread per NUMA node, and realized the
issue is much worse on these servers, as lock contention on rstat lock
happens more frequently, where 12 CPUs waste cycles on spinning every
time kswapd runs.  We added fleet wide stats (/proc/N/schedstat) for
kthreads, and realized we are on fleet wide average burning 20.000 CPU
cores on kswapd, that primarily spins on rstat lock.

Try to run this command to see kswapd CPU usage spikes:
   $ pidstat -u -C kswapd 1 60

Code wise: when the Per-CPU-Pages (PCP) freelist is empty,
__alloc_pages_slowpath calls wake_all_kswapds(), this cause wakeup calls
to all the kswapdN threads simultaneously. The kswapd thread will invoke
shrink_node, which as explained trigger the cgroup rstat flush operation
as part of its work. Thus, effectively the kernel's own memory
management processes triggers self-inflicted rstat lock contention, by
waking up all kswapd threads simultaneously.

So, we definitely need a solution to this issue!

I'm signing up to solving this somehow, as this is a real prod issue.

An easy way to solve the kswapd issue, would be to reintroduce
"stats_flush_ongoing" concept, that was reverted in 7d7ef0a4686a ("mm:
memcg: restore subtree stats flushing") (Author: Yosry Ahmed), and
introduced in 3cd9992b9302 ("memcg: replace stats_flush_lock with an
atomic") (Author: Yosry Ahmed).

The concept is: If there is an ongoing rstat flush, this time limited to
the root cgroup, then don't perform the flush.  We can only do this for
the root cgroup tree, as flushing can be done for subtrees, but kswapd
is always for root tree, so it is good enough to solve the kswapd
thundering herd problem.  We might want to generalize this beyond memcg.

This also looks like a whac-a-mole approach to me.

I'm not directly against rate-limited flushing, but I do think the 2 sec
interval is too long. IMHO we should be able to have a smaller bound in
the ms area.

Like I proposed 50 ms flush rate limiting in [2]

My production observations are that the thresholding code isn't limiting
the flushing in practice.

The 2 sec seems like a long period for me.

I'm running an experimental kernel with rstat lock converted to mutex on
a number of production servers, and we have not observed any regressions.
The kswapd thundering herd problem also happen on these machines, but as
these are sleep-able background threads, it is fine to sleep on the mutex.

It is a good point to re-check after obtaining the lock, as things could
have changed in the intermediate period when waiting for the lock. This
is also done (for time) in my 50 ms flush rate limit patch [1] ;-)

My pipe dream is that kernel can avoiding the cost of maintain the
cgroup threshold stats for flushing, and instead rely on a dynamic time
based threshold (in ms area) that have no fast-path overhead :-P

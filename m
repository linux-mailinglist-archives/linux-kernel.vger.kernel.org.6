As I promised earlier, I was going to test this patch series in detail.
Alas, I haven't managed to do that yet, :/ due to many reasons, but
I still remain firmly committed to doing that.

Is -rc4 the cutoff for 6.11?  If so, there's still time and I'll do my
best to test and review these patches as soon as possible.

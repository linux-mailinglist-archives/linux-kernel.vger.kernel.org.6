Yes. The BRBE code has no concept of groups either.

That's exactly what the driver does. It's not even that complex. We
have the BRBFCR and BRBCR register values for each event and just have
to OR them together for the enabled events. For filtering we just
compare each branch record to a mask of the enabled branch types for
the event.

That's exactly what the driver does.

That's exactly what the driver does.

There's not really any such thing as mismatching filters. There's no
mutually exclusive filters. The only effect having multiple events
enabling branch stack is you might run out of branch records sooner. A
CPU with a minimal number of branch records is going to have a similar
problem as will just enabling all branches on a single event. There's
not any way to fix that other than increasing the number of records or
adding a mechanism to the architecture to avoid dropping records.

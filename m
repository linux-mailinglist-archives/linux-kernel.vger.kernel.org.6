I've started to work on rebasing my current work onto your series today,
and I'm not entirely sure how what I described would best fit. Let's
assume we have two KMS device, one using shmem, one using DMA
allocations, two heaps, one using the page allocator, the other using
CMA, and one v4l2 device using dma allocations.

So we would have one KMS device and one heap using the page allocator,
and one KMS device, one heap, and one v4l2 driver using the DMA
allocator.

Would these make different cgroup devices, or different cgroup regions?

Yeah, definitely :)

Hi,

So I have been doing some benchmarking after Kanchana pointed out a performance
regression in [1] of swapping in large folio. I would love to get thoughts from
zram folks on this, as thats where large folio swapin was first added [2].
As far as I can see, the current support in zram is doing large folio swapin
at 4K granuality. The large granuality compression in [3] which was posted
in March is not merged, so I am currently comparing upstream zram with this series. 

With the microbenchmark below of timing 1G swapin, there was a very large improvement
in performance by using this series. I think similar numbers would be seen in zram.

But when doing kernel build test, Kanchana saw a regression in [1]. I believe
its because of swap thrashing (causing large zswap activity), due to larger page swapin.
The part of the code that decides large folio swapin is the same between zswap and zram,
so I believe this would be observed in zram as well.

My initial thought was this might be because its intel, where you dont have the advantage
of TLB coalescing, so tested on AMD and ARM, but the regression is there on AMD
and ARM as well, though a bit less (have added the numbers below).

The numbers show that the zswap activity increases and page faults decrease.
Overall this does result in sys time increasing and real time slightly increases,
likely because the cost of increased zswap activity is more than the benefit of
lower page faults.
I can see in [3] that pagefaults reduced in zram as well.

Large folio swapin shows good numbers in microbenchmarks that just target reduce page
faults and sequential swapin only, but not in kernel build test. Is a similar regression
observed with zram when enabling large folio swapin on kernel build test? Maybe large
folio swapin makes more sense on workloads where mappings are kept for a longer time?

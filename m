Sorry David, I've read your response a bunch of times and am still not
completely sure what you are advocating for.

To make my proposal crystal clear, I think we should leave the legacy counters
alone - neither change their name nor what they count (which is _only_ shmem). I
think we should rename the new mTHP counters to "shmem" and have them continue
to only count shmem. Then additionally, I think we should introduce new "file"
mTHP counters that count the page cache allocations (that's a future set of
patches, which I'm working on together with user controls to determine which
mTHP sizes can be used by page cache).

As suggested by Barry, I propose to also improve the documentation for the
legacy counters to make it clear that dispite their name being "file" they are
actually counting "shmem". I'll do this for v2.

David, would you support this approach? If so, I'd like to push this forwards
asap so that it gets into v6.11 to avoid ever exposing the mthp counters with
the "file" name.

Thanks,
Ryan

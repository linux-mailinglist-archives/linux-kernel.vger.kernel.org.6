This sounds like "load" in remoteproc terminology.

And these two are "start".

"this step" meaning TA_RPROC_FW_CMD_LOAD_FW? Above you say that happens
after you parse the resource table.

Sure, but as I say...inline rproc_start() here and the very next
operation we perform is something we call "load".

Why do we need to differentiate "load" and "load firmware", when we call
them at the same step in the sequence?

Looking at this again, if we move it, we need to duplicate it across a
few different call sites. So might need to take another look at that.

Still flatten the code and you seem to do:

if (load_fw)
	load_fw();
if (load)
	load();

Why do we need two different things named "load".

No need to make it more complicated than it is, change the symbol name
and fix the 3 places that calls the function.

You need to help me understand why load and load_new are both needed.

And no, "load_new" is not an ok name.

I'm probably misunderstanding your intention here, but I can't help
feeling that you add this code path to avoid understanding or fixing the
existing code.

Please tell me how that work. I'm not able to see the multiple calls to
request_firmware()...

This is done for some Qualcomm remoteprocs as well.

At the top of your reply you say that you're loading the firmware into
Linux memory, then you invoke TA_RPROC_FW_CMD_LOAD_FW to "load" it once
more - presumably copying into some other memory.

It sounds like this is an optimization to fail early in the case that
something is wrong?

Right, after authentication Linux must be locked out. That's done in the
Qualcomm "authenticate and start" phase, at the very end of the loading
and setting things up.

Ohh, now I see what you're saying. This is why you should follow
https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html#describe-your-changes
when you write a commit message. Then I would have understood your
problem in the very first paragraph of the patch.

This very much sounds like what's intended to happen in
rproc_parse_fw(), per the comment right next to the call:

/* Load resource table, core dump segment list etc from the firmware */


But I'm guessing that would require loading the segments etc into the
destination memory, perform the authentication and then you can get hold
of the resource table?

Which..per your patch you do before calling rproc_fw_boot(), so you're
already diverging completely from the expected flow.

> I can not use rproc_prepare_device() as it is not called on recovery
> 

The purpose of rproc_prepare_device() is to ensure that any clocks etc
for the memory where we're going to load the firmware is enabled, so
that doesn't sounds like the right place.

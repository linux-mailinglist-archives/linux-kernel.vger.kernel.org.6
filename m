What did you think of my approach that I detailed above? I would like to
avoid `Option<Option<_>>` if we can.

Depends on how common this is and if people need to use it. I think that
what I proposed above isn't that complex, so it should be easy to
implement.

Thanks for the pointer that's what I wanted to know (is it given from
somewhere else? or is it a name that we came up with), then it's fine :)

I think that will take some time until it is gone.

That should only be needed if you need `addr_of_mut!`, but IIUC, you
only need `addr_of!`, right?

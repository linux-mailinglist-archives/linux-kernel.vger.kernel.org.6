Ahh, got it now. Because now KVM knows about SPMACCESSR_EL1 register,
access to that register must also be enabled via both fine grained trap
(HDFGxTR2_EL2.nSPMACCESSR_EL1) and coarse grained trap (MDCR_EL2.EnSPM).

For all the registers that are being added via FEAT_FGT2 here in this
patch, their corresponding CGT based path also needs to be enabled via
corresponding CGT_MDCR_XXX groups.

Understood, for example PMIAR_EL1 register which FEAT_FGT2 now traps via

SR_FGT(SYS_PMIAR_EL1,           HDFGRTR2, nPMIAR_EL1, 0),

also needs to have corresponding coarse grained trap.

SR_TRAP(SYS_PMIAR_EL1,          CGT_MDCR_TPM),

Similarly corresponding SR_TRAP() needs to be covered for all registers
that are now being trapped with FEAT_FGT2.

Example code snippet.

Right, I understand your point now. I am planning to send out the following
patches (in reply to the current thread) for your review, before sending out
the entire series as V1.

- Patch adding VNCR details for virtual EL2 access
- Patch adding FEAT_FGT2 based FGU handling
- Patch adding corresponding CGT handling for registers being added above

Although, can skip that step and just send out the series directly if you so
prefer. Please do suggest. Thanks for all the detailed information above.

The bug report does not say anything about IMA issues. Please read the
bug reports before commenting ;-) I will ignore your comment because
it is plain misleading information.

I don't really care what you claim, I care what you code only at most.
Especially when topic shifted like it was now to IMA, which feels to
me like misguided communication tbh.

I don't think a round trip in kernel would qualify in that but there
is more low-hanging fruit too.

One low-hanging fruit improvement in the startup code is the handling
of null key. If it was flushed only on need, which means in practice
access to /dev/tpm0 or /dev/tpmrm0

I'm already working on patch set which adds chip->null_key that will
be flushed on-need basis only. I can measure with qemu how it affects
boot time.

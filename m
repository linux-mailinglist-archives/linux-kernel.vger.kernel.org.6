That certainly dates both of us, the last time I heard that phrase it

We certainly wouldn't choose to argue with any of this, given your
repertoire in the field of mandatory access controls and security
models.

But therein lies the rub with respect to the implementation of system
security.

There are what, maybe 5-6 people in the world like yourself, that have
the technical chops to translate the theoretical expressiveness you
describe above into functional, let alone maintainable, security
implementations?

If there was the ability to practically implement just about any
security model with SeLinux there would be no need for the LSM, yet
its existence has arisen, given the desire to support multiple
security schemes.  That alone would seem to suggest the lack of
technical prowess that is required to translate theoretical
expressiveness into practical implementations.

A primary challenge to security is scale of skill.

In the face of limited advanced security skills, we have hundreds of
thousands of people around the world creating and modifying millions
of workloads, on a daily basis.

I mentioned just recently, in a meeting with technical influencers
here in the Great State of North Dakota, that we are never going to
train our way out of this security problem.

Cisco recognized this with network security and this fact was central
to the concept of it's Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI).  With
respect to scale, ACI is based on the premise that the manageability
of network security has to be an artifact of the development process.

One of the motivations behind TSEM is to deliver that same concept to
system security.  The notion of allowing development teams to create a
customized, bounded and mandatorily enforced security behavior,
specific to a workload, as an extension of the development process.

Another tool in the 'Secure By Design' toolbox.  A concept that
entities like NIST, DHS/CISA and particularly the insurance companies
are going to force the industry to translate into practice,
particularly in critical infrastructure systems.

Have a good week.

As always,

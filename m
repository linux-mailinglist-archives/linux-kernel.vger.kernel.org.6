Can you please be more specific here? What kind of sharing is expected
on the user side of it?

What kind of resource sharing?

This doesn't explain, why would it want to share such memory with
another client.

There is nothing wrong here, but maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

General comment: maybe adding more detailed explanation of how the
capabilities are aquired and how they can be used might make sense.

BTW. It might be my imperfect English, but each time I see the word
'capability' I'm thinking that some is capable of doing something. I
find it hard to use 'capability' for the reference to another object.

Could you please point out any user for the uAPI? I'd like to understand
how does it from from the userspace point of view.

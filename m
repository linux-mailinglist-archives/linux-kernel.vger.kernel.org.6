We have a similar mechanism to what you mention below: we have a ROM
which encodes information about the platform and that can be read by
firmware/bootloader/OS.

I don't think this is a fundamentally different approach from my
proposal. Instead of composing a "unique" string and using regex to
match, I'm proposing that the information (bytes) that are in your
eeprom can be matched without going through regex/string conversion.
Instead of firmware/bootloader doing a conversion to the strings, it
provides the values via board-id. I have concerns about having
bootloaders to contain a regex library -- probably easily addressed by
standardizing what terms the regex processor needs to support. I'm also
not sure if regex strings are an appropriate use of compatible strings.
Using strings limits the usefulness of comaptible strings to the
consumers of DTB, since the compatible string has to describe only the
boards the DTB is applicable to, you can't mention compatible strings
"this board is like" such as some generic SoC compatible.

Mostly, I was referring to a situation where firmware provides an
overlay. Firmware doesn't know the DTB that OS has and I don't see any
way to gaurantee that firmware knows how to fix up the OS DTB.

Agreed, although not all devices can be loaded once you are in the OS.
All nondiscoverable devices would need to be desribed in the DT.

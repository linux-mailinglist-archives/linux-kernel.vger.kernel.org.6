Okay, so it sounds like it's the ->card_busy() callback that may not
work as expected after all.

Do we have an SD card slot on this platform that we can try to run
similar tests for but with an SD card instead?

We are not sending CMD13 to poll for busy, but we are indeed sending a
CMD13 *after* the card has stopped signal busy, to read the additional
status information.

This seems to be according to the spec.

As you have tested different cards, it's more likely to be a problem
with the platform/HW and the ->card_busy() callback.

Looks like this is the best option, unless we can figure out why the
->card_busy() callback doesn't work as expected.

This is the point where the interrupts were enabled. It allowed to
handle pending timers, including watchdog_timer_fn().
It printed this softlockup report.

It means that test_thread() never scheduled in the do while() loop.

I believe that the cond_resched() would cure the problem.

> If you mimic that touch_nmi_watchdog() above the udelay() in the function above,

The touch_nmi_watchdog() caused that watchdog_timer_fn() did not see
that "test_thread" kthread did not schedule. By other words, it did
hide the problem.

This is from check_hung_task(). It means that the task
TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE sleep for more than 122 second.

I guess that it is the wait_for_completion() called from __flush_work().

__lru_add_drain_all() does

	for_each_cpu(cpu, &has_work)
		flush_work(&per_cpu(lru_add_drain_work, cpu));

It is most likely blocked when waiting on the CPU which is occupied
by the "test_thread" kthread.

IMHO, it is not related to a process migration. It is just yet another
way how to get blocked by a task which is not scheduling.

Thanks a lot for proving these detailed debugging information.

I think that we need to add the cond_resched() into the do-while()
loop in nbcon_kthread_func(). Otherwise, the kthread would not
schedule in this loop with a voluntary preemption.

And it is a great catch! I haven't realized this when reviewing
the code.

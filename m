These messages are not normal and do not correspond to a drive that is slow to
spinup. These are generally indicative of bad communication with the device.
I ran into this the other day and solved the issue by using a better SATA cable...

If the drive is slow to spinup and takes time to start responding to commands,
you should see the message:

"link is slow to respond, please be patient "

which is issued by ata_wait_after_reset() -> ata_wait_ready(). The "1st FIS
failed" error indicates that the first H2D FIS sent to the device with the SRST
bit set does not give the correct answer, that is, the SRST bit is NOT set to
one in the Device Control register. Software reset should work always regardless
of the power state of the drive (spun down or not). So this error has nothing to
do with the timeout length, which is used for this first phase of the reset
sequence as a convenience but is really intended as a timeout value for waiting
for the link to become ready, which may take time if the device is spinning up.

This is the result of the sofreset failing due to the "1st FIS failed" errors,
and NOT due to the fact that the drive is slow to spin up.

The errors are still here... So either you have a bad SATA cable, or the drive
reset sequence is not per specs. Changing the timeouts to a longer interval is
not removing these errors, so you are not actually fixing anything here.

Please check your cable. If that does nothing, I suggest contacting the drive
vendor about this.

I have plenty of drives that are slow to spin up and they do NOT generate that
FIS error.

It's really adding a missing feature. We have cmdline but we don't have
DT. And in emebedded many times cmdline can't be changed.

In the context of eMMC there isn't any partition table and the cmdline
is hardcoded by the bootloader. The cmdline might provide the root
partition to use but doesn't declare the partition table (with cmdline)

And the bootloader with the hardcoded cmdline might provide a different
root partition in dual-boot-partition implementation on switching the
boot partition. (this is used a lot with bootloader using a env variable
and a different cmdline passed based on the variable to signal what
partition to use for root)

Why? This conflicts with how it's done on MTD. Also consider the fact
that eMMC might contain calibration partition used for NVMEM.

Describing fixed partition on a soldered eMMC that the bootloader
expects at a fixed offset and won't ever change (or it will result in a
brick) sounds like describing the HW to me. (it's the same principle of
MTD just applied to block devices)

(I know it sound strange as block devices are expected to have a
partition table in MBR or GPT but reality is that it's not always the
case)

Well it's either DT that can be tweaked and is part of the image or
cmdline that have tons of limitation due to bootloader having fun
hardcoding it or also actually requiring the bootloader cmdline and
adding overlay on it. Honestly as I said adding DT support is really
compleating the feature of the cmdline implementation.

The difficulty here is that these are opened as independent events (not
in the same event group), and so from the driver's PoV, this is no
different two two users independently doing:

	perf record -e event:u -j any,save_type -p ${SOME_PID}

	perf record -e event:k -j any,save_type -p ${SOME_PID}

.. where either would be surprised to get the merged result.

So, if we merge the filters into the most permissive set, we *must*
filter them when handing them to userspace so that each event gets the
expected set of branch records.

Assuming we do that, for Anshuman's case above:

	perf record -e cycles:u -e instructions:k -j any,save_type ls	

.. the overflow of the cycles evnt will only record user branch
records, and the overflow of the instructions event will only record
kernel branch records.

I think it's arguable either way as to whether users want that or merged
records; we should probably figure out with the tools folk what the
desired behaviour is for that command line, but as above I don't think
that we can have the kernel give both events merged records unless
userspace asks for that explicitly.

> Merging the settings in tools would be a much harder problem.

I can see that it'd be harder to do that up-front when parsing each
event independently, but there is a phase where the tool knows about all
of the events and *might* be able to do that, where the driver doesn't
really know at any point that these events are related.

Regardless, I assume that if the user passes:

	perf record -e cycles:u -e instructions:k -k any,u,k,save_type ls

.. both events will be opened with PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_USER and
PERF_SAMPLE_BRANCH_KERNEL, so maybe that's good, and in-kernel filtering
is sufficient.

As above, I think if we merge the HW filters in the kernel then the
kernel must do SW filtering. I don't think that's something we can leave
for later.

I completely agree that one event overriding another is not an
acceptable solution.

I think our options are:

1) Do not allow events with conflicting HW filters to be scheduled (e.g.
   treating this like a counter constraint).

2) Allow events with conflicting HW filters to be scheduled, merge the
   active HW filters, and SW filter the records in the kernel.

3) Allow events with conflicting branch filters to be scheduled, but
   only those which match the "active" filter get records.

So far (2) seems to me like the best option, and IIUC that's what x86
does with LBR. I suspect that also justifies discarding records at
context switch time, since we can't know how many relevant records were
discarded due to conflicting records (and so cannot safely stitch
records), and users have to expect that they may get fewer records than
may exist in HW anyway.

Mark.

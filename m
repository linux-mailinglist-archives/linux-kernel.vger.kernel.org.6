I still don't get it, this makes:

"""
Once the ksoftirqd is marked as pending (or is running), a softirq which
would have been processed at the end of the threaded interrupt, which runs
at an elevated priority, is now moved to ksoftirqd which runs at SCHED_OTHER
priority and competes with every regular task for CPU resources.
"""

ksoftirqd raised for timers still doesn't prevent a threaded IRQ from running
softirqs, unless it preempts ksoftirqd and waits with PI. So is it what you're
trying to solve?

Or is the problem that timer softirqs are executed with SCHED_NORMAL?

Oh I see now, that's all in __hrtimer_init_sleeper().

It's hard to tell for me as I don't know the !RT usecases for forced-threaded mode.

Yes.

Cool. You can add lockdep_assert_in_irq() within raise_ktimers_thread() for
some well deserved relief :-)

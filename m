Stumbling over Documentation/virtual/kvm/api.txt:

"In general file descriptors can be migrated among processes by means
of fork() and the SCM_RIGHTS facility of unix domain socket.  These
kinds of tricks are explicitly not supported by kvm.  While they will
not cause harm to the host, their actual behavior is not guaranteed by
the API.  See "General description" for details on the ioctl usage
model that is supported by KVM.

It is important to note that althought VM ioctls may only be issued from
the process that created the VM, a VM's lifecycle is associated with its
file descriptor, not its creator (process).  In other words, the VM and
its resources, *including the associated address space*, are not freed
until the last reference to the VM's file descriptor has been released.
For example, if fork() is issued after ioctl(KVM_CREATE_VM), the VM will
not be freed until both the parent (original) process and its child have
put their references to the VM's file descriptor.

Because a VM's resources are not freed until the last reference to its
file descriptor is released, creating additional references to a VM via
via fork(), dup(), etc... without careful consideration is strongly
discouraged and may have unwanted side effects, e.g. memory allocated
by and on behalf of the VM's process may not be freed/unaccounted when
the VM is shut down.
"

The "may only be issued" doesn't make it clear if that is actively enforced.

But staring at kvm_vcpu_ioctl():

	if (vcpu->kvm->mm != current->mm || vcpu->kvm->vm_dead)
		return -EIO;

So with KVM it would likely work to *not* care about mm-local memory 
allocations during fork().

But of course, what I am getting at is: if we would have some fd that 
uses an mm-local allocation, and it could be accessed (ioctl) from 
another active MM, we would likely be in trouble ... and not only fork() 
is the problem.

We should really not try handling fork() and instead restrict the use 
cases where this can be used.

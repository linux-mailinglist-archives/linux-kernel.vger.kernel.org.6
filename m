Yes. To summarize:
- keep your signoff as-is
- drop the command line param and handling
- make the outer protocol struct a union
- use 'unsigned long' for the version field
- keep the mixed_mode inner struct
- reorganize the conditional in setup_quirks() so that there are two
nested if blocks, where the memcmp() appears in the outer if() and
apple_set_os() is only called on Apple hardware

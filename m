The entire context are scheduled, ctx_sched_{in,out}.
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240507085807.GS40213@noisy.programming.kicks-ass.net/

The time in the guest mode doesn't be accumulated in the ctx->time,
which will be used to calculate the event time later.

The event_sched_in() never be failed (assuming enough PMU resources in
the host after be back from the guest). The time_enabled and
time_running should be equal.

Hi Yang,

Thank you for taking the time to review this patch series.

Thank you also for the spot. I am very much not an expert on
cpufeatures, but I think you are correct. IIUC, currently the .matches
check would go through as long as the the boot CPU executing the
.matches function has the correct MIDR value, and as long as
CONFIG_ARM64_ENABLE_BBML2 is set.

If, as you point out, another CPU has a MIDR that is not on this list
and which was not checked (because .matches only executes on a single
boot CPU), then .matches should still go through (and we could run into
problems when said other CPU executes any BBML2 aware code).

Please let me know if I have understood what you are saying correctly.

From re-reading `include/asm/cpufeature.h`, making it a SCOPE_LOCAL_CPU
feature seems to be close to what we want. We want to have each CPU test
its cpuid against the allowed MIDR list, and the feature overall to
only be considered present if *all* boot cpus returned true (not as
SCOPE_LOCAL_CPU puts it "... detect if at least one matches.").

I will see if this can be hacked around with the current system, and if
not, we might have to extend the current cpucaps scopes / machinery like
you suggest in your patch series comments.

okay got it, that makes sense.

Ohkay I see, we then do not need pm_runtime_enabled() check for qcom 
platforms before putting the vote.
I am currently modifying this patch only to directly add
pm_runtime_resume_and_get()/pm_runtime_put_autosuspend()
around the register access of PRR related adreno private interfaces.
I will send this updated patch as part of v18 shortly.

Additionally, we can evaluate the use of pm_runtime operations for 
set_ttbr0_cfg() and resume_translation() in a separate series ?

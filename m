I think this use case is important. Not just for profiling applications 
but even something that wants to monitor itself. I imagine opening 
PERF_COUNT_HW_CPU_CYCLES or INSRUCTIONS is actually somewhat common, and 
I don't think every application that wants to do perf system calls 
should have to maintain JSON mappings for all platforms. That doesn't 
sound feasible to me, unless there is a smart way to do it? Maybe the 
mappings could be in libperf or something? But then that still requires 
everyone to add that as a dependency and keep it up to date. By that 
point you might as well just add them in the kernel and keep the 
existing interface.

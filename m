Yes, the dynamic API was exactly what I needed unfortunately. I'm porting the kernel module we have to Rust (using our own bindings as
we cannot mandate CONFIG_RUST=y). While I have some support for C code generation based on the Rust source, it is significantly more
convenient to simply use a dynamic API. In the current state of my code, defining an event is as simple as:

   let f = new_event! {
   	lisa__myevent2,
   	fields: {
   		field1: u8,
   		field3: &CStr,
   		field2: u64,
   	}
   }?;
   
   // Emit the event
   f(1, c"hello", 2);
   f(3, c"world", 4);

So it's as non-confusing can be: the event name is stated plainly and the field names and types are mentioned once, with no repetition.
The result can simply be called to emit the event, and when dropped, the event is unregistered.


On top of that in ways unrelated to Rust:
1. We have some really high traffic event (PELT-related) that include some data that is not always needed (e.g. taskgroup name).
    We currently regularly hit memory size limitation on our test device (pixel 6), and using trace-cmd record instead of
    trace-cmd start is not always a good idea as this will have an effect on scheduling, disturbing the very thing we are trying
    to observe. Having the dynamic API means we could simply omit the fields in the event that we don't care about in a specific
    experiment via dynamic configuration.

2. Some events may or may not be supported on the system based on some runtime condition. Currently, there is no great way for
    the module to feed back that info. No matter what, the event exists, even if the machinery that is supposed to emit it is
    disabled for whatever reason. If some user starts tracing the event "everything will work" and there will be no event in the
    trace. That may make the user think a condition did not trigger, whereas in fact the whole machinery was simply not operating.
    Being able to register or not the event dynamically solves that cleanly, as enabling the event will simply fail as it won't
    have been registered in the first place.

3. We will likely at some point relay events coming from some non-CPU part of the system into the ftrace buffer. If and when that
    happens, it would be ideal if that producer can simply declare the events it supports, and our module dynamically create the
    matching synthetic events. That would avoid any problem coming from mismatching source that would otherwise plague such setup.

So considering things seem to work overall with not much tuning needed, it would be sad to have to revert to TRACE_EVENT() macro
and end up having to do more work for a worse result. If that's the route you choose though, it may be nice to amend the
documentation to clearly state this API is testing-only and not supported in normal use case, as it currently reads:

   The trace event subsystem provides an in-kernel API allowing modules
   or other kernel code to generate user-defined 'synthetic' events at
   will, which can be used to either augment the existing trace stream
   and/or signal that a particular important state has occurred.

Thanks for the clarification, Dmitry.

As of today, if the property is present in DT, non-secure fastrpc device will be created
for ADSP and as there are no checks to restrict daemons to use only secure node, there
will not be any failures observed. So there is no error if non-secure property is added
for ADSP and your 2nd point holds here.

Problems with the current design are(you can look into below points independent of the change):

1. This creates a security concern as any process that can open non-secure device
can replicate daemon to attach to DSP root PD and cause troubles there which is not
a good thing. So basically any trusted process(maybe same group) should only use secure
device node and any process using non-secure node should only offload to unsigned PD.

2. Having this property well defined also help in scaling fastrpc driver for new domains(like CDSP1
was recently introduced) as driver can only rely on the "label" and "non-secure-domain" property
for device creation. Say, only secure device is create if property is not defined and both device nodes
are created if non-secure-domain is define. This way, the dependency on domain_id can be removed
from fastrpc_rpmsg_probe[1] and create either only fastrpc-xdsp-secure or both(secure and non-secure).

This however is a regression as you have mentioned, but it it helps address multiple problems.

Should I discuss further on documentation or is any more design clarification should be done here?

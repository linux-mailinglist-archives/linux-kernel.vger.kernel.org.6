Yeah and it's not just the delay, it's also the fact that you may read
the stats *after* an event (e.g. proactive reclaim or memory usage
spike), and get the stats from *before* the event. This leads to wrong
decisions being made by userspace.

I'd rather we keep the flushers consistent to avoid complexity if
possible (i.e. if Shakeel's patch works for you). But if that's the
only way going forward maybe that's what we need for now.. I will wait
to see the code.

I took a brief look at the ones in the reclaim path and I don't think
they are easy to remove tbh. Maybe MGLRU will become the default soon
and they naturally go away (MGLRU does not have these flushes).

That's one more reason I think maybe this needs to be handled in the
reclaim path. I do not think other flushers relate to this situation.
It would be nice if we can just skip the flush in the reclaim path
under these circumstances.

Do we know that switching to a mutex in the current state is
problematic? If the only concern is priority inversion then a timeout
should work.

Also, I don't think a mutex will help your case of kswapd not running
fast enough, right?

Yeah we may need to completely skip the flush under dire circumstances
in the reclaim path, as I mentioned above. This feels more like a
reclaim problem than an rstat problem at this point.

Yeah there is a plan to remove these.

Nhat, are you currently working on this? If not I can try to find a
few cycles to address this.

So you observed production problems with completions even when only
root cgroups are allowed to be the ongoing flusher, after you thought
it fixed the problem initially. Did I get that right?

The information about these fields are documented in header 
include/dt-bindings/arm/qcom,ids.h
sent in patch 1.

We can have multiple DT for different DDR types and boot device types. 
In order to distinguish different DT when
all other parameters are same, we are using DDR type, boot device type 
as distinguishable parameters.

ok, will try to redefine it. Meantime, since Elliot has some suggestions 
from his EOSS conference presentation,
will also co-work with him towards making another attempt at vendor 
agnostic approach as well.

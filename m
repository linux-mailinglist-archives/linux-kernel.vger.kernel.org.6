I don't think that helps here, but that is something I'd be interested
in.

What I would like for this is:
 - a single #define for RCU_NR_OLDSTATES for both RCU and SRCU

 - a way of getting the current RCU gp sequence number without a
   function call, since we hit that on every single enqueue(). One of my
   development versions added a function to RCU and SRCU for getting a
   pointer to the internal sequence number, which we'd call at init
   time; this lets us skip the function call and a branch. 

Another thing that might make the code a bit easier to reason about is
if rcu_read_lock() also worked as an srcu_read_lock() - is something the
SRCU variant you're talking about previously would provide?

In my current version of the code, we call __get_state_synchronize_rcu()
after we've disabled interrupts; we know the rcu gp seq isn't going to
tick while we're in the critical path. But this doesn't apply if it's
for SRCU, and I don't want to add if (src) srcu_read_lock() branches to
it.

Not at all essential, the races that result from this are harmless, but
if we e.g. decide it's worthwhile to only kick off a gp if it hasn't
ticked (i.e. only kick rcu if we're still on seq of the object being
enqueued) it'd be nice.

No, the radix tree nodes are 512 bytes; that's been sufficient in my
testing.

(also, please don't refer to PAGE_SIZE outside of mm/ code without a
_good_ reason; that's something we've been trying to clean up.)

I'll try to post some performance numbers when I have some time.

As long as the thread calling kvfree_rcu_mightsleep() can block without
blocking memory reclaim it'll be safe. We might want to tweak the GFP
flags so to tell the allocator "don't try too hard, bail out so we can
check if the gp has expired".

Funny, I had the same thoughts trying to read your code... :)

But, most of __rcu_pending_enqueue() is slowpaths; the fastpath is just

	objs = get_object_radix(p, seq); /* lookup seq in p->objs */

        *objs->cursor++ = ptr ?: head;                                                                                                       
        /* zero cursor if we hit the end of a radix tree node: */                                                                            
        if (!(((ulong) objs->cursor) & (GENRADIX_NODE_SIZE - 1)))                                                                            
                objs->cursor = NULL;                                                                                                         
        start_gp = !objs->nr;                                                                                                                
        objs->nr++;

So I think the performance concerns are moot, and for robustness -
memory allocation failure always turns into "use the linked lists of
objects", which works similarly to the old code.

True. But this would allow us to prefetch those objects (several
iterations in advance).

Just processing a few items? hmm, would we want to though, when
otherwise we'd be calling kfree_bulk()? I think icache locality means
we'd generally prefer not to.

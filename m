The argument certainly makes sense to me.

I would have assumed that there is already a level of randomization for this use
case because vmalloc will be allocating random pages from the buddy, so the
location of a given vmalloc alias in the linear map is already somewhat random?

Perhaps the regions of interest are allocated early in boot when the pages the
buddy gives you are still pretty predictable? In this case could there be any
argument for adding a capability to the buddy to give out somewhat randomised
pages, at least during boot?

Personally this change feels like it's encouraging fragmentation, the 
cleanest would be if RISC-V supports the legacy events like the other 
platforms. It's not a huge set of events anyway, and then existing 
software continues to work in addition to Perf continuing to work.

If we're still thinking that RISC-V will support the legacy events 
anyway in the future, then it weakens the argument to change this and 
risk any breakages that fall out of it.

I'm also not sure whether they really are legacy or just a common base 
set of events. Since the extended type thing was added even the legacy 
events support hybrid, so it's not like they expired from lack of 
features. Even if we claim they're legacy, is that really ever going to 
make them go away?

Although I admit nobody has come out with a definitive use case that 
doesn't use either the cycles or instructions events, so maybe its all fine.

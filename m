Because what is stored in the flash (eMMC) can be dynamically updated.
It's not a description of the HW as such, but I guess it depends on
how you see it. No matter what, you need to convince the DT
maintainers that this is the way to do it.

In my opinion, I think it would be better to invest our time to try a
different path.

I guess it's somewhat a greyzone in this kind of case, assuming you
are referring to a bootloader that is stored in some ROM code that
can't be updated.

I fully understand that but there are different ways to deal with that
too. Maybe enforce to write an MBR/GPT when flashing, assuming it
doesn't overwrite some data that is needed.

Another option is to let the bootloader parse some platform specific
data in the flash (unless it's hard coded in there too) and then make
it update the block-devparts for the kernel command line, for example.

Another option is also to parse the platform specific data in some way
and create partitions by using initramfs.

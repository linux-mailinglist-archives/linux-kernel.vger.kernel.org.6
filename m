As per your design idea,do you mean to use qcom_smmu_client_of_match to 
identify the device using compatible string and apply the device 
specific settings for all the SoCs (instead of StreamID based device 
identification) ?

something like this rough snippet(?):

qcom_smmu_find_actlr_client(struct device *dev)
{

	if (of_match_device(qcom_smmu_client_of_match, dev) == 
qcom,fastrpc-compute-cb )
		qcom_smmu_set_actlr_value(dev, (PREFETCH_DEEP | CPRE | CMTLB)); 
/*where (PREFETCH_DEEP | CPRE | CMTLB) is used for compute-cb client.*/

	else if (of_match_device(qcom_smmu_client_of_match, dev) == qcom,adreno )
		qcom_smmu_set_actlr_value(dev, (PREFETCH_SHALLOW | CPRE | CMTLB)); 
/*Where (PREFETCH_SHALLOW | CPRE | CMTLB) is for adreno client. */

}

Let me know if my understanding is incorrect.
Then in this case if different SoC would have a different settings for 
same device, then everytime a new compatible would be necessary for same 
device on different SoC?

On similar lines there is another TBU based approach which I can think 
of. Identify the TBU -> Identify clients from TopoID derived from SID 
range specified in qcom,stream-id-range -> Apply the client
specific settings ?

Both approaches would be driver-based, as they are now.

Also I'd like to point out that in the current design, since we fixed 
the smr_is_subset arguments to make the stream IDs a subset of entries 
in the actlr_cfg table, we can reduce the number of entries in the 
table. This way, fewer SID-mask pairs can accommodate several stream IDs.

Thanks & regards,
Bibek

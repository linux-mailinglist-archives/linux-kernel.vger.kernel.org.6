This series (in particular the first patch) broke boot on Intel Meteor
Lake-P. Taking Linux next of 20240819 with these being reverted makes
things work again.

Taking into account bisectability issue (that's how I noticed the issue
in the first place) I think it would be nice to have no such patches at
all in the respective subsystem tree. On my side I may help with testing
whatever solution or next version provides.

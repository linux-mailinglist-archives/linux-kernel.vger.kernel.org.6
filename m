Hi Frederic,

Thanks for having a crack at this, but I'm pretty confused now so please
prepare for a bunch of silly questions!

I should've been clearer in my reply, but I think the most important thing
here for the arm64 heterogeneous SoCs is that we document whatever the
behaviour is in Documentation/arch/arm64/asymmetric-32bit.rst. There are
a few other kernel features that don't play well (e.g. SCHED_DEADLINE),
so it might be sufficient just to call out the limitations relating to
CPU isolation there.

However:

In the funky SoCs, all CPUs support 64-bit and we have a 64-bit kernel.
Some CPUs additionally support 32-bit but that should only be a concern
for the scheduling of user tasks.

I'd have thought the bigger problem would be if the set of nohz_full=
CPUs was defined as the set of CPUs that support 32-bit. In that case,
executing a 32-bit task will give the scheduler no choice but to run
the task on a !housekeeping core.

So perhaps we could turn this on its head and explicitly mark the first
32-bit capable CPU as a housekeeping core when the mismatched mode is
enabled? We're already preventing CPU hotplug for the thing, so it's
"special" already. If that conflicts with the nohz_full_option, we can
emit a warning message that we're overriding it. I think that's ok, as
the user will have had to specify 'allow_mismatched_32bit_el0' as well.

Will

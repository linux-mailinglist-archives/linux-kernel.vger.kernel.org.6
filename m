+1, I was considering writing exactly the same while reading your
review until I reached this paragraph. devm_* is a nice dream, and maybe
APIs that simplify cleanup in a similar way can be implemented (possibly
based on cleanup.h), but behind the scene they will need to rely on a
sound reference-counting base.

One interface per region means the regions could be independently
reprogrammed, i.e. reprogramming of one region won't affect the working
of another region. But they don't have to be reprogrammed in parallel.
If it cannot be reprogrammed now, the interface call could fail.

MM.. I don't actually understand what's the fundamental differences
between full & partial. If a full region supports full & partial
reconfiguration, the full region contains partial regions as
sub-devices. The partial reconfiguration reallocates it sub-devices and
won't change partial region itself. The full reconfiguration also
reallocates it sub-devices including partial regions, and won't change
full region itself.

Thanks,

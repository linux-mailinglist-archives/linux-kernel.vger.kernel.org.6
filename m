Upstreaming prematurely, prior to finalizing all solutions, will have a
significant pain point like this. I recognize the extra workload
involved in reviewing these changes, but our aim is to minimize future
maintenance efforts. SA8775p with non-SCMI resource solutions is going
to be deprecated.

The SA8775p is currently undergoing active development, with Qualcomm
firmware updates altering essential resources such as clocks,
regulators, etc. designs, to align with safety requirements.

Yes, ABI is going to break/evolve as sa8775p moves to scmi based
infrastructure. Auto product line intends to subsequently submit
corresponding changes for sa8775p while derived part qcs9100 support,
continue evolve in conventional manner.

For instance, in this binding, ‘clk’, ‘resets’, and other elements are
mandatory if ‘compatible’ includes qcs9100. However, after the SCMI
resource solution is checked in, for ‘compatible’ containing sa8775p, it
may only require ‘power-domains’ and ‘power-domain-names’.”

A reference to one SCMI resource solution RFC, which will definitely
require some changes, can be found here[1]:
[1]
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1709657858-8563-4-git-send-email-quic_sriramd@quicinc.com/

The proposed solution(with compatible differentiation) will exhibit the
following differences in addition to the current RFC.[1] :

1. Both have SCMI and non-SCMI support in the same driver.
The binding documentation will specify that ‘qcs9100’ compatibility
requires properties such as ‘clk’, ‘reset’, ‘vdd’, etc., while ‘SA8775p’
compatibility necessitates properties like ‘power-domains’,
‘power-domain-names’, etc., as mandatory.

2. having a /delete-property/ becomes unnecessary.
The proposed solution will introduce a completely new SA8775p.dtsi from
the outset. The current qcs9100.dtsi will not be included into this new
SA8775p.dtsi.

3. Driver C files will not eliminate calls to ‘clk’, ‘vreg’, etc.
Instead, they will differentiate with a ‘qcs9100’ compatibility to
include operation with legacy "clk", "vreg" calls, while ‘sa8775p’ will
incorporate operations calls for ‘power-domains’, and so on.

4. "hsphy,fw-managed" property to indicate SCMI resources is not necessary.
Current patch have been using a DT property " hsphy,fw-managed;" to
figure if it is SCMI based vs non-scmi. While it is going to be
suggested to be designed to use "sa8775p" compatible.

SA8775P is already announced Auto SOC for our OEMs. We can't ask for
creating new Auto SKU to show the solution w/ SCMI like "SA8775P<XYZ>".

Since the current code of SA8775P is matching w/ what is required for
the purpose of QCS9100 s/w architecture the clear rename was proposed.
It will also look odd to IOT customers to see their SOC DT file starting
w/ the SA8775P.

For the current Qualcomm device trees in upstream, we still use ‘soc’
naming in the base soc device tree, which is consistent with our current
hardware SOC naming convention. The basic <soc_name>.dtsi is, by
default, aligned with the current market name of the SOC.

Welcome comments and suggestions on the information we have proposed above.

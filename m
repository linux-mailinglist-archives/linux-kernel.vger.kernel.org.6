Understand the concept of lack of bandwidth.

Had a 40 hour week in as of 0800 yesterday morning and the end of the
week isn't even remotely in sight.

Not relevant right now but I do remember, personally at a conference,
Stallman railing on about the threat of signed code and what it
represents with respect to software and device freedom.

Not much bandwidth for the rest of the day but I wanted to get this
question/issue out to get some feedback for later tonight,
particularly from your perspective John.

We saw these issues coming about four years ago, which is why we
decided to take a deep breath and bring TSEM out of private use to a
wider audience, it isn't a 'pet project' as it has been referred to.
Not sure we would do that again but that is an issue for another day.

TSEM is based on the notion of having a generic modeling architecture
for the LSM.  I know that Casey bristles at the notion of us saying
'model', but we can prosecute that argument in intimate detail at
another time.

We would best characterize TSEM as a 'swiss army knife' for
interpreting kernel security events.  You can run the event
interpretation in the kernel, in userspace, in a hardware device or up
in the cloud.

After watching Tetsuo's concerns over the last year we dropped the
loadable module support into TSEM for the V4 release:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20240826103728.3378-1-greg@enjellic.com/T/#t

This offers the ability to run the interpretation model via code
implemented in a loadable module.  BPF is also an option but we are
keeping things simple at this point.

So we use the standard loadable module architecture.  We offer the
ability to lock further model loads or unloads after a set of models
have been loaded and the option to completely disable any loadable
models at boot, independent of the general kernel loadable module
state.

It doesn't fully fix Tetsuo's problem, given that a distribution could
compile out TSEM, just like it compiles out Tomoyo, I think we all
agree there is no fix to that problem.  However, if the security bigs
like CrowdStrike, PaloAlto and others, understand that it allows EDR
telemetry and surveillance to be implemented on Linux without having
to install a high privilege or kernel based agent, it makes not having
it in the kernel less attractive.

Just for the sake of advancing these conversations, we are throwing
some bandwidth into implementing Tomoyo as a TSEM loadable module to
get some further insight on the tractability of something like this.

With your distributor hat on does an architecture like this offend
your security sensibilities?

Like it or agree with it, we seem to be standing at a reasonably
important inflection point for Linux, conversations probably suitable
for a 'Summit' type event.

Will look forward to your thoughts.

Have a good day.

As always,
Dr. Greg

So if your module has an i32 parameter, you can't set a default value to
eg 1000?

Couldn't I just emulate the behavior from above by creating a
`struct MyI32(i32)` and having a default value?
In that case, why make it more difficult instead of providing a simple
way to do it?

Can't you also do the custom parameter parsing from above? ie have an
integer parameter with a default value?
Or is that frowned upon (ie not allowed through review)?

So we are only going to use it for `bool`?

Ah I see, I missed that.

By that argument, we should also not permit custom implementations to
specify a default value.

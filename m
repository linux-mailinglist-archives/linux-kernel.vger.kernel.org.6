So actually the new solution I suggested a little after that original email
wouldn't need to call local_irq_save() directly - sorry, I just explained i=
t
kind of poorly and it hadn't been in my head for very long. I think you'll
like this solution a lot more though, lemme explain:

Basically instead of having functions like with_interrupts_disabled, we wou=
ld
instead introduce a new trait that can be implemented by locks with context
tokens: BackendWithContext:

pub trait BackendWithContext: Backend {
type ContextState;

unsafe fn lock_first(ptr: *Self::State)
-> (Self::Context, Self::ContextState, Self::GuardState);

unsafe fn unlock_last(
ptr: *Self::State,
context_state: Self::ContextState,
guard_state: &Self::GuardState
);
}

Where the idea is that a type like SpinlockIrq would define ContextState to=
 be
a u64 (holding the flags argument from spin_lock_irqsave). lock_first() wou=
ld
use spin_lock_irqsave and create the token, unlock_last() would use
spin_unlock_irqrestore with the saved ContextState. Then we could use those
unsafe primitives to implement a method on Lock like this:

impl<T: ?Sized, B: BackendWithContext> Lock<T, B> {
pub fn lock_with_new<'a>(
&self,
cb: impl FnOnce(Self::Context, &mut Guard<'a, T, B>) -> R
) -> R;
}

What lock_with_new would do is:

 * call B::first_lock() (which would be spin_lock_irqsave)
 * call cb() with a LocalInterruptsDisabled token and a &mut to the Guard (=
so
   that the caller can't drop the lock before exiting the noirq context)
 * Call B::last_unlock() with the ContextState that was passed to first_loc=
k()
   (which would be spin_unlock_irqrestore)

So we'd absolutely still be modeling around the locking primitives
spin_lock_irqsave() and spin_unlock_irqrestore(). And subsequently we could
still nest lock contexts like normal. with_irqs_disabled() wouldn't be need=
ed
in this arrangement - but we would still need the Interrupt tokens (which
would be fine since they're just for enforcing correctness anyway).

I think you misunderstood something somewhere - this has always been the ca=
se
with the bindings I submitted that you don't need a context for all locks,
only locks that define one. That is why we reimplement lock() to look like
this (where T is the data protected by the lock and B is the backend):

pub fn lock<'a>(&'a self) -> Guard<'a, T, B>
where
B::Context<'a>: Default
{
self.lock_with(Default::default())
}

So SpinLock's B::Context is (), which implements Default - meaning you can
acquire it simply like this:

some_lock.lock();

But that wouldn't work for SpinLockIrq with a context of IrqDisabled<'a>,
since IrqDisabled doesn't implement Default.

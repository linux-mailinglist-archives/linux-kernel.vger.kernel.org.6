With lockdep, the lock acquisition and release in complete_with_flags()
would splat, though this could be handled by using a low-level lock
acquisition and release that didn't mess with lockdep.  With the resulting
risks of missed deadlock detection, of course!

With tracing enabled, there is the trace_sched_waking() within
try_to_wake_up() along with the trace_sched_wakeup() within
ttwu_do_wakeup().  And more beyond that, but I am lazy this morning.  ;-)

There were also ARM32 splats that have aged out of my mental cache.

Don't you still need the initial state for the boot CPU?

For that to work, we need all architectures to be OK for Tasks Rude RCU
being removed, right?  Plus that would make all of arch_cpu_idle_dead()
untraceable.  Is that a good thing?

Not entirly sure yet, but I agree some fix would be good!

I think I found a couple of problems with this issue. :(

 1. perf_session__set_id_hdr_size() uses the first evsel in the session
    But I think it should pick the tracking event.  I guess we assume
    all events have the same set of sample_type wrt the sample_id_all
    but I'm not sure if it's correct.

 2. With --call-graph dwarf, it seems to set unrelated sample type bits
    in the attr like ADDR and DATA_SRC.

 3. For tracepoint events, evsel__newtp_idx() sets a couple of sample
    type regardless of the configuration.  This includes RAW, TIME and
    CPU.  This one changes the format of the id headers.

 4. PERF_RECORD_LOST_SAMPLES is for the sampling event, so it should
    use the event's sample_type.  But the event parsing looks up the
    event using evlist->is_pos which is set for the first event.

 5. I think we can remove some sample type (i.e. TID and CPU) from the
    tracking event in most cases.  ID(ENTIFIER) will be used for LOST_
    SAMPLES and TIME is needed anyway.  TID is might be used for SWITCH
    but others already contain necessary information in the type.  I
    wish we could add id field to PERF_RECORD_LOST_SAMPLES and tid/pid
    to PERF_RECORD_SWITCH.

Thanks,
Namhyung

I have not forgot, tried a few things, but nothing really to post as of
now...dont wnat to rush either .... I was hoping to push something out at
the end of this next merge window...

No I am fine, I am planning anyway for something generic enough to be
easy then to plug your own quirks separately...

v6.15 seems hard/impossible even using the original Sibi patch 
given the usual upstreaming-timeline of the SCMI stack where everything has
to be usually reviewed and accepted by rc4/rc5.....so both Sibi initial
patch and my own babbling were alreaady sort of late.

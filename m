We would be substituting one OOM problem for another with this patch.

The 'if (!list_empty(dst))' was there so that if the spinlock is contended and we are still skipping, then the shrink_active/inactive_list can still use the ones that are in destination, rather then continue skipping.

Both the original patch and this fix substitute one OOM problem for another one.

Yeah I think the 2nd point about compaction is a bigger issue, we can try fixing the 2nd point by clearing lru, but the first point will remain. I will send a revert for the original.

In fact, "mm: move the check of READ_IMPLIES_EXEC out of do_mmap()" does
not have the locking issue. These two patches are quite different. This is
also the modification I recommended, while another modification was
suggested by LSM maintainers(Perhaps I need to add suggested-by? But
that was mentioned in a non-public security mailing list, and I'm not sure
if it's appropriate.).

The __core__ problem is "no LSM hook" +
"have logic about READ_IMPLIES_EXEC". Removing one of them is OK.

The "mm: move security_file_mmap() back into do_mmap()" fixes this by
adding a LSM hook. The requirement to call LSM hooks comes from the
LSM modules, _not these call sites_. The issue for locks also comes
from the specific implementation of LSM modules. So I send patches
to LSM maintainers at the same time.

The "mm: move the check of READ_IMPLIES_EXEC out of do_mmap()" fixes this
by removing the logic about READ_IMPLIES_EXEC that is not needed. So no
locking issues there(no changes to LSM). This will result in some minor
behavioral changes for call sites mentioned in the patch. Unfortunately,
due to this logic being placed in a single function do_mmap now, it is
impossible to confirm it through patches one by one before change the mm
module. Fortunately, these changes should clearly be fine, and here are
the reasons(more specific versions):

fs/aio.c, mm/util.c, ipc/shm.c: no changes
arch/x86/kernel/shstk.c: Shadow Stack is stack only store return
addresses, adding execute permission to shadow stack is never
required.
mm/mmap.c: in the history, remap_file_pages won't care about the
READ_IMPLIES_EXEC. this side effect is introduced in the emulated
version, after the deprecated mark exists. The patch only removes the
side effects introduced. And this(mm) is the module. :)

BTW, The link is the _first step_ in required(if the check is missing in
that call site, there will be a bug) call sites, which has been done.

Perhaps adding sufficient comments is also a completely appropriate method
as another alternative.

Thanks for your kind review!

Sure, I will try non-VHE as well.

We do have the FEAT_ECV on AmpereOne, I was the one reported/fixed bug 
with FEAT_ECV(CNTPOFF offset issue) in the past.

I see the kernel I am testing has this patch[1].

Yes, this is what I tried to explain. LR shows pending, but UEFI is not 
consuming and treating it as spurious since ISTATUS is not set.

Sure, I will give a try with below diff and let you know tomorrow.
This should work, I remember, this was the one of the option/fix that we 
tried as fix while debugging.

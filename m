Ah, if only. NM lists the symbol table, and that has strictly more
information than kallsyms, notably it includes symbol length. Using
symbol length it is trivial to distinguish the case you're tripping
over.

Which is a kallsym bug that does not exists in the ELF space.

There is a patch set that tries to fix this here:

  https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240723063258.2240610-1-zhengyejian@huaweicloud.com/T/#u

Instead of adding size to kallsyms it adds extra symbols to denote the
holes, which ends up being similar.

Linker, this is link time. The linker would not only have to drop the
(weak) symbol from the symbol table (which is all it really does), but
it would now have to go and muck about with other sections.

It would have to go re-write the __mcount_loc section and drop entrie(s)
that were inside the dropped symbol. But then, what about other extra
sections? For instance, we can have (and still patch) alternatives in
the 'dead' weak text.

Where does this stop?

LTO can do the right thing and completely eliminate the weak function,
but anything short of that is a really big ask. Esp. since this is a
problem of our own making -- kallsyms is a flawed representation of the
symbol table.

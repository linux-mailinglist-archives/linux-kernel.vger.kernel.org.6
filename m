Embarrassingly, I don't recall that converstation at all :-| but at least what I
said then is consistent with what I've done in this patch.

I think David's conclusion from that thread was to call them FILE_, and add both
shmem and pagecache counts to those counters, meaning we can keep the same name
as legacy THP counters. But those legacy THP counters only count shmem, and I
don't think we would get away with adding pagecache counts to those at this
point? (argument: they have been around for long time and there is a risk that
user space relies on them and if they were to dramatically increase due to
pagecache addition now that could break things). In that case, there is still
inconsistency, but its worse; the names are consistent but the semantics are
inconsistent.

So my vote is to change to SHMEM_ as per this patch :)

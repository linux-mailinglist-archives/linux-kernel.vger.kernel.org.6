I didn't know about this patch-set, however as of right now QEMU does
not set VIRTIO_CONSOLE_F_SIZE, never uses VIRTIO_CONSOLE_RESIZE, and
resizing is never mentioned in hw/char/virtio-console.c or
hw/char/virtio-serial-bus.c. Suffice to say I don't see any indicating
of resize currently being used under QEMU. Perhaps QEMU supported
resizing at one point, but not anymore. If you disagree please send me
where the resizing logic can currently be found in the QEMU source
code. I at least was unable to find it.

I'm working on implementing console resizing for virtio in QEMU and
Libvirt. As SIGWINCH is raised on the virsh frontend the new console
size needs to be transfered to QEMU (in my RFC patch via QOM, which
then causes QEMU to trigger a virtio control msg in the chr_resize
function of the virtio-console chardev). (The patch-set should make its
way unto the QEMU mailing-list soon). The way I implemented it QEMU
sends a resize control message where the control message has the
following format:

```
struct {
    le32 id;    // port->id
    le16 event; // VIRTIO_CONSOLE_RESIZE
    le16 value; // 0
    le16 cols;  // ws.ws_col
    le16 rows;  // ws.ws_row
}
```

This strongly seems to me to be in accordance with the spec[0]. It
resulted in the rows and cols being switched after a resize event. I
was able to track the issue down to this part of the kernel. Applying
the patch I sent upstream, fixed the issue.
As of right now I only implemented resize for multiport (because in the
virtio spec I was only able to find references to resizing as a control
message which requires multiport. In your email you claimed that config
space resizing exists as well. I was only able to find references to
resizing as a control message in the spec. I would love to see what
part of the spec you are refering to specifically, as it would allow me
to implement resizing without multiport as well).=20
It seems to me that either the spec or the kernel implementation has to
change. If you prefer changing the spec that would be fine by me as
well, however there seems to be no implementation that uses the linux
ordering and Alpine seems to patch their kernel to use the spec
ordering instead (as described in the initial email)(this was really
Niklas Schnelle's finding so for further questions I would refer to
him).

I would say the pros and cons of swapping in a large folio are the same as
the pros and cons of large folios in general.
As mentioned in my cover letter and the series that introduced large folios
you get fewer page faults, batched PTE and rmap manipulation, reduced lru list,
TLB coalescing (for arm64 and AMD) at the cost of higher memory usage and
fragmentation.

The other thing is that the series I wrote is hopefully just a start.
As shown by Barry in the case of zram in 
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20240327214816.31191-1-21cnbao@gmail.com/
there is a significant improvement in CPU utilization and compression
ratios when compressing at large granularity. Hopefully we can
try and do something similar for zswap. Not sure how that would look
for zswap as I haven't started looking at that yet.

Right now whether or not zswapin happens is determined using
/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/hugepages-*kB/enabled
I assume when the someone sets some of these to always, they know that
their workload works best with those page sizes, so they would want folios
to be swapped in and used at that size as well?

There might be some merit in adding something like
/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/hugepages-*kB/swapin_enabled,
as you might start thrashing swap if you are for e.g. swapping
in 1M folios and there isn't enough memory for it, which causes
you to swapout another folio in its place.

Thanks for having a look!
I had only tested with the microbenchmark for time taken to zswapin that I included in
my coverletter.
In general I expected zswap activity to go up as you are more likely to experience
memory pressure when swapping in large folios, but in return get lower pagefaults
and the advantage of lower TLB pressure in AMD and arm64.

Thanks for the test, those number look quite extreme! I think there is a lot of swap
thrashing. 
I am assuming you are testing on an intel machine, where you don't get the advantage
of lower TLB misses of large folios, I will try and get an AMD machine which has
TLB coalescing or an ARM server with CONT_PTE to see if the numbers get better.

Maybe it might be better for large folio zswapin to be considered along with
larger granuality compression to get all the benefits of large folios (and
hopefully better numbers.) I think that was the approach taken for zram as well.

I hope next week to have a better look at this, in tne meantime just a
few considerations....

Sooner or later we should have introduced some sort of quirk framework
in SCMI to deal systematically with potentially out-of-spec FW, but as
in the name, it should be some sort of framework where you have a table of
quirks, related activation conditions and a few very well isolated points
where the quirks are placed and take action if enabled...this does not
seem the case here where instead an ad-hoc param is added to the function
that needs to be quirked...this does not scale and will make the codebase
a mess IMHO...

Last but not least, these quirks 'activations' in the SCMI world should
be driven mainly by the VENDOR/SUB-VENDOR/IMPLEMENTATION_VERS triple and
only as a last resort by a platform compatible match...because the
IMPLEMENTATION_VERSION, exposed by the FW and gathered via SCMI Base
protocol, is completely under the vendor control so it can, and should, be
used to identify broken FW-versions...indeed all the distinct SCMI protocols
are anyway versioned elsewhere according to the spec, so there is no need to
repeat SCMI protocol version here..I mean it is an IMPLEMENTATION version

As an example on a JUNO the SCP reference FW reports:

arm-scmi arm-scmi.1.auto: SCMI Protocol v2.0 'arm:arm' Firmware version 0x20f0000

where the FW version represent something like the FW release tag, I think...not
really sure about the menaing our FW gys give to it, BUT definitely it is not
a bare copy of the SCMI protocol version...

So...
...does the platfom-to-be-quirked at hand properly use the IMPLEMENTATION_VERSION
flag in a sensible way ?
IOW does that change between a bad and good (or less bad :D) version ?
Because shooting with the platform 'compatible-gun' should be the last resort
if all of the above does NOT happen in this beloved fw...

Anyway, after all of this babbling, I know, talk is cheap :D...so now I will shut
up and see if I can prototype something generic to deal with quirks, possibly
next week...

Thanks,
Cristian

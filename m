Yeah, because those are mainly for the tests, and we are expecting that if
any modules wants to emit its events, it will define new trace-events and
use it instead of synthetic events. The synthetic events are for
programming via tracefs, not reporting from the kernel modules.
It is confusing if any synthetic events are reported without any origin of
real trace event. (so, it is an intermadiate event type.) IOW, We expect
that synthetic event is reported by other events via event trigger.
The current APIs are just for testing.

Hmm, I should hide those by CONFIG_SYNTH_EVENT_TESTS.

No, please don't touch the synthetic events for reporting any events via
kernel modules. Those should use normal trace events for avoiding the
confusion.

Would you have any reason not to use normal trace events?

Thank you,

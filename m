While the standard says that it should act as 5 instead of 1 and that
it's not an error to access padding, the point of the __counted_by
attribute is to check that the user isn't doing anything "bad" by
going outside of whatever bounds have been put in place. So I wouldn't
want __bdos(p->a_entries, 0) to return 5 when the initial allocation
is for 1. It's confusing given the documentation for the attribute.

I would be in favor of disabling __bdos on a whole struct pointer if
it will match the functionality between the compilers. I don't think
Qing has that on her plate at the moment, but when / if she revisits
that we can discuss exactly how to perform the calculations then.

I reported a similar issue to GCC a while back. The response is that
it's not incorrect, because the size is still valid (padding, etc.).
Their view is that, even when asked for the size of the subobject,
they want to return some value, even if it's larger than the
subobject, but not outside the bounds of the full object. I strongly
disagree that it's okay to do that, but I'm probably in the minority.
Clang's support for 1 as the __bdos's second argument isn't great. I'm
trying to fix it, but got sidetracked by higher priority issues.

So in conclusion, if turning off the calculation for a pointer to the
whole struct works, then I'm okay with it.

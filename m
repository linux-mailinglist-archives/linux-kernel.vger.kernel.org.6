That looks like a hack to me and don't prefer that and there would be
multiple mappings for a single device and that could complicate device
resource accounting.

We need to know what other functionalities are supported and how that
will be used ?

In the worst case, you could define register bases for each port in the
CCU device node.

TDFU@.. {
	reg = <base-address 4K>

	<I don't know the standard property name for> =
	List of {
	<port number>, <Offset from base>,
	}
}

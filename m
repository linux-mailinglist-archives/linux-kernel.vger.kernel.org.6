Is this a signature from a v3 key, or a v3 signature? Unfortunately
there are implementations which will issue a v3 signature even from a v4
key; IIRC this ambiguity has been cleared up in the updated RFC.

I don't believe allowing a v3 *key* gives a useful verification that is
worth supporting. However unfortunately I think it sounds like support
for v3 signatures from v4 keys is necessary.

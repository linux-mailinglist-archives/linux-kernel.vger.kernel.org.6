kdump has a kexec kernel 'standby' to launch when the kernel panics.
So for the UKI/EFI payload case, this would imply that the load
involves running the payload until EBS() and freezing the state.

Whether execution occurs in true user space or in a deprivileged
kernel context is an implementation detail, imho. We don't want to run
external code in privileged mode inside the kernel in any case, as
this would violate lockdown already. But it should be feasible to have
a EFI compatible layer in the kernel that invokes the EFI entrypoint
of an image in a way that protects the host kernel. This could be user
mode on the CPU or perhaps a minimal KVM virtual machine.

The advantage of this approach is that the whole concept of purgatory
can be avoided - the EFI boot phase runs in parallel with the previous
kernel, which has full control over authentication and [emulated] PCR
externsion, and has ultimate control over whether the kexec reboot is
permitted.

I don't think intermediate kernels are the solution here. We need to
run as much as possible under the control of the preceding kernel, and
minimize the bare metal handover that occurs after EBS(). Adding more
code to the purgatory (as this series does) is not acceptable to me,
as it is extremely difficult to debug, and duplicates drivers and
other logic (making it an 'intermediate kernel' of sorts already)

Today, UKI functionality is implemented in terms of EFI API calls. Any
solution that needs either a parallel implementation (eBPF vs EFI) or
needs to unpack the UKI in order to perform the steps that the UKI
would perform itself if it were executed in an EFI environment is a
no-go in my opinion.

So either we provide some EFI compatible runtime sufficient to run a
UKI, or we re-engineer UKI to be built on top of an abstraction that
can be implemented straight-forwardly both on system firmware and in
the EFI context.

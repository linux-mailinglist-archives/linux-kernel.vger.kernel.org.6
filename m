It all sounds so obvious when you put it like that! :)

I'm guessing there is a layer where the workaround can be applied to the
sanitised feature registers on a per-cpu basis and that won't affect this global
override which will remain as an overlay on top? If so then that sounds perfect
(you can probably tell I find the whole feature management framework rather
inpeneterable). That workaround would be added as part of Yang's series anyway.

So sounds like we are back to testing MMFR2.BBM in the matches function, with
the addition of Maz's proposal above. Sorry for sending you round the houses, Miko.

Thanks,
Ryan

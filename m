Yes, that's correct. If an attacker is able to modify page tables then
kpkeys are easily defeated. (kpkeys_hardened_pgtables does mitigate
precisely that, though.) On the topic of aliases, it's worth noting that
this isn't an issue with page table pages (only the linear mapping is
used), but if we wanted to assigning a pkey to vmalloc areas we'd also
have to amend the linear mapping.

The assumption is that the attacker has acquired a write primitive that
could potentially allow corrupting any kernel data. The objective is to
make it harder to exploit that primitive by making critical data immune
to it. Nothing stops the attacker to turn to another (unprotected)
target, but this is no different from hypervisor-based protection - the
hope is that removing the low-hanging fruits makes it too difficult to
build a complete exploit chain.

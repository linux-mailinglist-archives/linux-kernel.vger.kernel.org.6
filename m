What's particularly confusing is that most of the IDs encoded here don't 
actually seem to line up with what's in the respective SoC DTSIs...

However by this point I'm wary of whether we've lost sight of *why* 
we're doing this, and that we're deep into begging the question of 
whether identifying devices by StreamID is the right thing to do in the 
first place. For example, as best I can tell from a quick skim, we have 
over 2 dozen lines of data here which all serve the exact same purpose 
of applying PREFETCH_DEEP | CPRE | CMTLB to instances of 
"qcom,fastrpc-compute-cb". In general it seems unlikely that the same 
device would want wildly different prefetch settings across different 
SoCs, or even between different instances in the same SoC, so I'm really 
coming round to the conclusion that this data would probably be best 
handled as an extension of the existing qcom_smmu_client_of_match mechanism.

Thanks,
Robin.

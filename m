Hi James,
This isn't excluding AMD. AMD just happens not to have a feature common 
to the other architectures.
Intel TDX, Arm CCA, and RISC-V COVE all provide architectural 
measurement registers. SEV happens not to have these today but should 
they in the future, they can draft off of the work here.
Might also be worth remembering the original author of the series 
represented RISC-V COVE.

While someone can emulate a TPM using the architectural measurement 
registers as a backing store, they don't have to. Certainly it's also 
possible to provide a vTPM in a protected region of memory, but that 
shouldn't block the legitimate interests of using the architectural 
features of TDX, CCA, and COVE.

This was helpful feedback. Cedric incorporated it into v3 of the RFC series:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-coco/20241210-tsm-rtmr-v3-2-5997d4dbda73@intel.com/

We thought your silence on v3 meant you were happy with that feature. 
Lots of threads to track though so also not surprised if you didn't see 
it, or possible we misinterpreted your feedback.

It is retained in this patch set:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-coco/20250212-tdx-rtmr-v1-2-9795dc49e132@intel.com/

Now I have something to look forward to today. :-D

I am not sure how this could lead to a deadlock. The compression will be
happening in a different pool with a different acomp_ctx.

IIUC, outside the context of CPU onlining, CPU hotplug callbacks get
called when they are added. In this case, only the newly added callbacks
will be executed. IOW, zswap's hotplug callback should not be randomly
getting called when irrelevant code adds hotplug callbacks. It should
only happen during zswap pool initialization or CPU onlining.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

I believe this is already the case as I previously described, because
the hotplug callback can only be called in two scenarios:
- Zswap pool initialization, in which case compress/decompress
  operations cannot run on the pool we are initializing.
- CPU onlining, in which case compress/decompress operations cannot run
  on the CPU we are onlining.

Please correct me if I am wrong.

I think that's a lot of memory to waste per-CPU, and I don't see a good
reason for it.

Agree that using a single acomp_ctx per-CPU but making the resources
resizable is not a win.

I am not sure what's the deadlock scenario you're worried about, please
clarify.

Adding versions of the -Wconversions warning which triggers only
in very specific cases should not be too difficult, if something
like this is useful, i.e. restricting the warning to assignments.

If one wanted to, one could always pass bitfields inside a struct

typedef struct { unsigned int v:12; } b12;

int f(b12 x)
{
    int i =3D x.v;
    return i & (1 << 13);
}

the compiler is then smart enough to know how many bits are
relevant and track this to some degree inside the function.


https://godbolt.org/z/o8P3adnEK

But using this information for warnings would be more difficult
because the information is not computed in the front end. (but=C2=A0
here also other warnings generated by the backend, so not
impossible). And, of course, the=C2=A0additional wrapping and
unwrapping makes the code more ugly (*)

C23 then also has bit-precise integers.

(*) ...but compared to what some other languages require the
programmer to write, even=C2=A0 this seems relatively benign.

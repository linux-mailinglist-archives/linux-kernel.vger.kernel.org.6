I think I understand the inaccuracy concern now.  So, it is the 2 second
periodic flush that is the concern.  That can cause up-to 2 seconds old
data to be read by userspace, when read contend with ongoing root
flusher (if it doesn't wait for the flush).  I agree, that 2 sec old
data is too inaccurate.

I'm coding V11 that will "wait_for_flush" in the userspace call paths.

I like the idea of eliminate all in-kernel flushers.
Until someone works on that I will use my patch in production as I need
to fix the production issues ASAP.

We are observing kswapd isn't running "fast-enough" in production (e.g.
when packet process using GFP_ATOMIC alloc are starting to fail).  Thus,
I really don't want to delay 11 other kswapd threads, by waiting on a
flush, I really prefer to skip the flush, such that they can do the much
needed memory reclaim work.

My plan is to lower contention on this rstat lock "enough" (e.g. with
this patch), which should make it safer to switch to a mutex.

I will also try out Shakeel's patch. This will hide the specific
contention issue until something starves the kthread that does the
periodic 2 second flush (for 2 periods). In production we are seeing
kthreads getting starved longer than 20 seconds.  This often happens in
connection with OOM killer. This recreates the kswapd lock contention
situation at a very unfortunate point in time.  Thus, it makes sense to
have this ongoing flusher lock contention protection in place.

BTW, there is still a mem_cgroup_flush_stats() remaining in
zswap_shrinker_count(), that we might still hit, after Shakeel's patch.
And a direct call to do_flush_stats() in obj_cgroup_may_zswap().

[1] is V8 (that allowed ongoing flusher below level 2) which production
experience from that shows that we need to confine ongoing flusher to
being the root cgroup only.  (This already worked in V2).  The V9
production experience shows that using 'completions' caused issues and
implementing this race free is very hard.

I've coded a V11 that reduce the places we skip-the-flush on contention,
and wait-for-flush in all the userspace reader cases.

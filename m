Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Update events from v35 to v36.
Update TMA metrics from 4.8 to 5.02.

Bring in the event updates v36:
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/616ec6fc0315dac35c1bea0abc7f59e21a2=
d51c0

The TMA 5.02 update is from (with subsequent fixes):
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/1d72913b2d938781fb28f3cc3507aaec5c2=
2d782

Remove duplicate event UNC_CLOCK.SOCKET that was erroneously left in
uncore-other.json.

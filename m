You can by invoking sched_show_task(cpu_curr(cpu)) on the CPU requesting
the backtrace.  The resulting backtrace will not be as good as you
would get from using an NMI, but if you don't have NMIs, it is better
than nothing.

And it also makes sense for an IRQ-based backtrace to fall back to
something like the aforementioned sched_show_task(cpu_curr(cpu)) if
the destination CPU has interrupts disabled.

Boolean is fine for trigger_single_cpu_backtrace(), which is directed at
a single CPU.  And the one call to this function that does not currently
check its return value could just call dump_cpu_task() instead.

There are only 20 or so uses of all of these functions, so the API can
change, give or take the pain involved in changing architecture-specific
code.

Suppose datacenters all do this.  What part of this issue remains?

If you are using NMIs, and the CPU doesn't respond in 10 seconds,
something is likely broken.  Maybe bad firmware or bad hardware.  You are
right that watchdogs might trigger, but they are likely already triggering
due to the target CPU being so firmly locked up that it is not responding
even to NMIs.

On the other hand, when you are not using NMIs, then I agree
you want a shorter timeout before remotely tracing the staek via
sched_show_task(cpu_curr(cpu)).  I picked a few milliseconds, but if
datacenters are using real NMIs or pseudo NMIs (and thus are not being
blocked by normal interrupt disabling), then I must defer to others on
the default timeout.  Much depends on the workload and configuration.

						Thanx, Paul

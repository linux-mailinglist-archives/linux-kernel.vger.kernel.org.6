As the MVEBU Maitnainer, i'm always happy to see new kirkwood
boards. It has been a number of years since the last one was
contributed.

Yes, it is. Think about openwrt! It will have one kernel configuration
for all kirkwood boards. If one device needs NVMEM, they all get
NVMEM.

Well, no not really. What you say is true for 'modern' systems,
anything which is less than 10 years old. But kirkwood is very old. It
was one of the SoCs which pushed the adaptation of DT. I did a lot of
work adding DT bindings to all the Marvell drivers, so that kirkwood
and orion5x could make use of DT, rather than board files. But back
then u-boot had no support for DT. u-boot had no idea about DT
blobs. The blob was just appended to the end of the kernel
bZimage. u-boot just loaded the 'kernel' into memory, and the kernel
knew to look for it at the end of the image.

As you say, u-boot knows the MAC addresses. But Marvell decided on a
unique way to pass them to Linux. The Marvell u-boot programmed the
MAC addresses into the Ethernet controllers. So when Linux booted, the
MAC addresses are already set.

But part of DT was clock support, using the common clock
framework. Towards the end of the boot, CCF turns off all clocks which
have not been claimed. If the Ethernet driver has not loaded yet, the
clock is not claimed, and so it got turned off. And when the clock is
turned off, the ethernet controller forgets its MAC address :-(

We hacked around this. During early boot, this bit of code looked in
the Ethernet controller and reads out the MAC address, and modifies
the DT blob, adding the MAC addresses in the usual place. When the MAC
driver probes, it then uses the normal API to get the MAC address.

We need to ensure this change does not break this. If we 100% know
there is a MAC address in nvmem, we can skip reading the MAC out of
the hardware. But if there is an nvmem, but not MAC addresses in it,
we need to read the MAC addresses out from the controllers. Hence the
exact meaning of EPRODE_DEFER is important.

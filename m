Yup, I think that's it.

Yeah the Foreign (or Mixed as I called them) we'd only add when needed,
and then only for functions where we know it's still safe to do so on the
rust side.

I also agree that the maintenance burden really needs to be on the mixed
drivers going through transition, otherwise this doesn't make much sense.
I guess Ideally we'd ditch the Foreign types asap again when I driver can
move to a stricter rust type ....

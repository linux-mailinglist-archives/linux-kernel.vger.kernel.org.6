I think if there is no suspend/resume interaction, we should go back
to the original idea of page allocation in drm/msm.

Basically, I think the pros and cons are:

allocate in arm-smmu
  pro: easy to sequence programming with suspend/resume
  con: there isn't a convenient place to free the page on driver unload

allocate in drm/msm:
  pro: easy place to free the page in teardown
  con: harder to sequence with s/r

But if ACTLR and PRR_CFG_LADDR/UADDR are retained, then the con isn't
actually an issue ;-)

Anyways, I can type that patch..  the rest of drm/msm and userspace
changes (vm_bind + sparse) to get to the point where I can use PRR are
a somewhat bigger task so it will take me a while to get the point
where I can test any smmu patches.

BR,

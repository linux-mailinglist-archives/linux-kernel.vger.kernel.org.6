To be clear, we have no current plan to do this from the Arm side.

My sketch was just a thought experiment to test whether we would have
difficulties _if_ a decision were made to extend the interface in that
direction.

But it looks OK to me: the interface proposed in this series seems to
leave enough possibilities for extension open that we could do
something like what I described later in if we decide to.


Overall, the interface proposed in this series seems a reasonable way
to support ABMC systems while keeping the consumer-side interface
(i.e., reading the mbm_total_bytes files etc.) as similar to the
classic / Intel RDT situation as possible.

MPAM can fit in with this approach, as demonstrated by James' past
branches porting the MPAM driver on top of previous versions of the
ABMC series.

As I understand it, he's almost done with porting onto this v11,
with no significant issues.

Cheers

That's fine, it's not a priority. And if this patch set makes sure we
don't crash when things go wrong, I'm okay with leaving it as is.

It's possible that jbd2_journal_commit_transaction() could call
ext4_handle_error() in other places as the code evolves. Fixing known
problems and protecting against potential ones is always a good thing.

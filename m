So, making users to figure out what is the best event to use for some
specific processor was one of the major reasons for perf to come about,
otherwise we would still be stuck with oprofile.

While it is clear that picking some "most important event and ratios of
events" is super difficult, that was one of the ideas that made perf to
come about.

I wasn´t the architect of this, Ingo and Thomas were, with Peter then
tryhing to make the kernel part sane.

I just tried to follow those principles while not getting in the way of
people wanting to have a common ground for observability in Linux.

Having all these JSON tables was in place was a major concession to that
original vision.

Changing things as we go, with all these changes in the hardware
landscape, some fleeting, some reinforced, is super difficult and leads
to all this pain in trying to provide a sane experience to people using
these tools.

I don't think we can have it super consistent.

It is super useful as is, or at least that what people say.

So we need to keep on improving it while not telling people used to its
workflows that they should re-learn the tool because at some point a
decision was not properly made.

you can present it like that, or you can say that they wanted the API to
be different but since it wasn't like they liked they had to comply.

Differently phrased he finally understood the value of the current API,
maybe.

Well, maybe just the event name shouldn't be what determines if it
should be used in some cases? Maybe some other characteristic should be
probed for in each case?

Have to stop here, not enough bandwidth.

My userspace readers (of /sys/fs/cgroup/*/*/memory.stat) are primarily
cadvisor and systemd, which doesn't need this accuracy.

Can you explain your userspace use-case that need this accuracy?

I assume you are primarily focused on memory.stat?
Can we slack on accuracy for io.stat and cpu.stat?

Detail: reading cpu.stat already waits on the ongoing flusher by always
taking the lock (as it use lock to protect other things).  This
indirectly created what you are asking for... If your userspace program
first reads cpu.stat, then it will serve as a barrier that waits for the
ongoing flusher.

Could we have a sysctl that enabled "accurate" cgroup rstat reading?
As most users don't need this high accuracy.

IMHO waiting for ongoing flushers was not a good idea, as it caused
other issues. Letting 11 other kswapd wait 24 ms for a single kswapd
thread was not good for our production systems.

I need remind people that "completely skipping the flush" due to ongoing
flusher have worked well for us before kernel v6.8 (before commit
7d7ef0a4686a).  So, I really don't see skipping the flush, when there is
an ongoing flusher is that controversial.

I think it is controversial to *wait* for the ongoing flusher as that
IMHO defeats the whole purpose of having an ongoing flusher... then we
could just have a normal mutex lock if we want to wait.

It is not only the flush in the kswapd path that concerns me.
My other concern is userspace cadvisor that periodically reads ALL the
.stat files on the system and creates flush spikes (every minute).  When
advisor collides with root-cgroup flush (either 2 sec periodic or
kswapd) then bad interactions happens in prod.

Practical implementation (with completions) and production experiments
is what changed my mind. Thus, I no-longer agree that waiting for the
ongoing flusher to complete is the right solution.

To move forward, can you please list the flushers that cannot accept 
this trade off?
Then I can exclude these in the next version.

It is not different roots, it is needed for "the-same" root.

It is possible that while an ongoing flusher is working, another process
can call the flush in "strict" mode (for same root cgroup), that will
bypass the ongoing check, and it will be waiting for the lock.  The
ongoing flusher chooses to yield the lock, letting in the strict-mode
flusher that then clears the ongoing flusher, unless we add this ID
check.  I hope it is more clear now.

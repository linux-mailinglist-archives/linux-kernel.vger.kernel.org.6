That's where I firmly disagree. In the DMA API aspect, iommu-dma is 
exactly a peer of dma-direct, however it lives in drivers/iommu for 
practical reasons because it's more closely coupled to IOMMU API 
internals in all other aspects of its implementation. TBH what I'd 
really like is a private interface between mapping.c and dma-iommu.c 
which doesn't expose internal details via include/linux/ at all, but 
*that's* a level that I think people may rightfully start to object to.

Thanks,
Robin.

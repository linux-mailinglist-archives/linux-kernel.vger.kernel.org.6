Currently the architecture can only tell us about the BBM support level.
Currently level 2 is the highest and that permits an implementation to raise a
conflict abort instead of handling it in HW.

Since this series only relies on BBML2 for user space memory, we believe we
could contain and handle any conflict abort safely (the first version of this
series handled the abort). But Yang Shi has a series on list that aims to use
BBML2 to enable dynamically splitting the linear map. It becomes much harder to
reason about the safety of any conflict abort in that case.

Will was keen to take this approach were we decide if the HW supports
"BBML2+NOABORT" semanitics based on the MIDR. Plans are in flight to fix the
arch so we can tidy this up long term, but Will didn't want to hold up Ampere.

Thanks,
Ryan

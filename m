There is no such table. The event log is exposed by the firmware via a
TCG2 protocol interface, which is no longer available after boot. So
the stub loader (which is the last kernel component that has access to
this interface) invokes this protocol and copies the output into a
table in memory which is exposed to the kernel proper as a EFI
configuration table.

So the main issue here is that EFI configuration tables are passed on
to kexec kernels, and we have to ensure (in the general case) that the
associated memory is not reused. The implication is that the stub
loader should always use EFI_ACPI_RECLAIM_MEMORY for allocations that
are referenced via EFI configuration tables, and doing so for this
table makes the bug go away.

It was not made clear, that is why I raised the question. I argued
that the TPM log has limited utility after a kexec, given that we will
be in one of two situations:
- the kexec boot chain cares about the TPM and measured boot, and will
therefore have extended the TPM's PCRs and the TPM log will be out of
sync;
- the kexec boot chain does not care, and so there is no point in
forwarding the TPM log.

Perhaps there is a third case where kdump wants to inspect the TPM log
that the crashed kernel accessed? But this is rather speculative.

Agreed.

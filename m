Thank you for your explanation.
My patch does not change this logic.

The commit b4536f0c829c ("mm, memcg: fix the active list aging for
lowmem requests when memcg is enabled") has removed the emptiness check.

What is meaningful is that we can determine whether the size is smaller
than 0 before adding `nr_pages`. However, as I mentioned, the
`lru_zone_size` can only be modified in the `mem_cgroup_update_lru_size`
function, which means that a warning must have been issued if the size
was smaller than 0 before adding `nr_pages` when `nr_pages` is greater
than 0. In this case, it will not issue a warning again.

Perhaps "when it can usefully compare whether the emptiness of the list
correctly matches lru_size 0" is not useful now.

Thank you very much for your patience.

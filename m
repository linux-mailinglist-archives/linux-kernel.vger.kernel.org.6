For fifo there are multiple sources on internet, but none of them is
normative. Everything is just what people have tried. For example this
old email on samba list:
https://lists.samba.org/archive/linux-cifs-client/2005-May/000856.html

Format of the socket I have figured out by creating it in Interix
subsystem and then dumped content of the file from Win32 subsystem.
Then I checked that it has also same format over older MS NFS server.
It was easier than trying to search for some documentation (which I have
not found).

I was searching over internet again and now I have found patent
https://patents.google.com/patent/US20090049459 which describe symlink
content:

#define NFS_SPECFILE_LNK_V1  0x014b4e4c78746e49 /* “IntxLNK” */

But does not describe other types.

I fully understand your concerns, but code in this patch is for creating
new fifos. Not recognizing existing fifos.

Code for recognizing existing fifos (=empty file with system attribute)
was not changed and is in Linux cifs client for a very long time.

And if nobody complained yet then this is probably not an issue.

You can create manually on server empty file, mark it as system and then
Linux cifs client even without these changes would recognize that file
as fifo.

I see. Now I understand what are those types (as I have not seen them
before). It is somehow misleading if such "LnxFIFO" and LnxSOCK"
functionality is provided by SFU option, but is incompatible with MS SFU
and also with MS NFS server. And is also incompatible with older Linux
cifs clients (as they do not understand those Lnx types).

Yes, new WSL tags seems to be better. Also SFU mount option is not
activated by default.

Reading from fifo sleep reading process until some other process write
data to fifo. This is how fifos are working. You can try it on local
filesystem (e.g. ext4 or tmpfs).

$ mkfifo fifo
$ strace cat fifo

You will see in strace output of cat something like:
...
openat(AT_FDCWD, "fifo", O_RDONLY

And once you write to that fifo by other process (e.g. echo abc > fifo)
then cat will unfreeze and continue:

                                        = 3
fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFIFO|0644, st_size=0, ...}) = 0
fadvise64(3, 0, 0, POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL) = -1 ESPIPE (Neprípustné nastavenie pozície)
mmap(NULL, 139264, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7f17a34bb000
read(3, "abc\n", 131072)                = 4
...

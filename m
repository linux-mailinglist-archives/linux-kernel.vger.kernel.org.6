Fair enough.  Part of this is the paranoia that has served me so well.
But which can also cause the occasional problem.  On the other hand,
we really do occasionally lose things during CPU hotplug operations...

No failures.  But might it be wise to put this WARN_ON_ONCE() in,
let things go for a year or two, and complete the removal if it never
triggers?  Or is the lack of forward progress warning enough?

Agreed.  And I vaguely recall that there was some difference due to
preemptible RCU's ability to clean up at the next rcu_read_unlock(),
though more recently, possibly deferred.

Makes sense to me.

I fired off a 30-minute run of 100*TREE03 with this change also.

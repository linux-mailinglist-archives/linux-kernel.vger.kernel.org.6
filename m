Right, figured that eventually but these were not very clear at first.

Did not follow that. Both in ddi0601/2024-03 XML and ARM ARM DDI 0487K.a
there are no positive trap bits, either in HDFGRTR2_EL2 or HDFGWTR2_EL2.
OR did I miss something here.

Sure, will add the following new registers in arch/arm64/tools/sysreg format
except for the ones that require a formula based enumeration. Those will be
added into arch/arm64/include/asm/sysreg.h directly e.g

+#define SYS_SPMEVCNTR_EL0(m)           sys_reg(2, 3, 14, (0 | (m >> 3)), (m & 7))
+#define SYS_SPMEVTYPER_EL0(m)          sys_reg(2, 3, 14, (2 | (m >> 3)), (m & 7))
+#define SYS_SPMEVFILTR_EL0(m)          sys_reg(2, 3, 14, (4 | (m >> 3)), (m & 7))
+#define SYS_SPMEVFILT2R_EL0(m)         sys_reg(2, 3, 14, (6 | (m >> 3)), (m & 7))

Alright, as you prefer, in future will keep the questions in separate

Sure, will check ID_AA64DFR0_EL1.ExtTrcBuff for FEAT_TRBE_MPAM instead.

Okay, will check ID_AA64DFR0_EL1.PMSVer for FEAT_SPE_FDS instead.

Thanks for pointing out the feature check work arounds.

Understood.

Seems like positive and negative trap bits do not make any difference
here, while setting respective bits in kvm->arch.fgu[HDFGRTR2_GROUP]. 
In this case the inverse should be dropped for all bits.

Should the lone trap bit (nPMZR_EL0) which is present in HDFGWTR2_EL2
but not in HDFGRTR2_EL2, be set in kvm->arch.fgu[HDFGWTR2_GROUP] as
well ?

if (!kvm_has_feat(kvm, ID_AA64DFR0_EL1, PMUVer, V3P9)) {
	kvm->arch.fgu[HDFGRTR2_GROUP] |= HDFGRTR2_EL2_nPMUACR_EL1;
	kvm->arch.fgu[HDFGWTR2_GROUP] |= HDFGWTR2_EL2_nPMZR_EL0;
}

Okay.

Thanks for the review and the related pointers.

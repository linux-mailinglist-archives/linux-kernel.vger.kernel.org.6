Hi Vitaly,

Thanks for the elaborate writeup

Why does this require a mechanism in the upstream kernel at all?
Signing the kernel (which includes appending a cert table) does not
require such changes, so why is this needed when adding an additional
PE/COFF section?

I'm sure this paragraph will make some skeptics happy.

We never cared about the CRC32 before with signed EFI images, which
gets clobbered when the image is signed. Why should we start caring
about it now?

Please don't create a special case for x86 again - iff this needs to
be in upstream (which I am not convinced about) it needs to be
implemented for all architectures.

So I'd like to understand better what is preventing you from appending
a PE/COFF section on an arbitrary bzImage (or EFI zboot image).

Given an arbitrary PE/COFF image, I see

  Section {
    Number: 4
    Name: .data (2E 64 61 74 61 00 00 00)
    VirtualSize: 0x47000
    VirtualAddress: 0x934000
    RawDataSize: 4608
    PointerToRawData: 0x934000
    PointerToRelocations: 0x0
    PointerToLineNumbers: 0x0
    RelocationCount: 0
    LineNumberCount: 0
    Characteristics [ (0xC0000040)
      IMAGE_SCN_CNT_INITIALIZED_DATA (0x40)
      IMAGE_SCN_MEM_READ (0x40000000)
      IMAGE_SCN_MEM_WRITE (0x80000000)
    ]

as the last section. There should be sufficient space in the header to
add an additional section descriptor.

So what is preventing us from just appending the SBAT data to the
file, and creating a 5th section that lives right after .data both in
the file view (at 0x934000 + 4608) and in the memory view (0x934000 +
0x47000). That should produce a valid PE/COFF image, no?

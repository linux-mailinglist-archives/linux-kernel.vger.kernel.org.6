Think about this again, it seems that we no longer need the destroying
flag. Because we force to commit and wait for the **last** transaction to
complete, and the flush work should also ensure that the last sb_update
work to complete. Regardless of whether it starts a new handle in the
last update_super_work(), it will not commit since the journal should
have aborted. What are your thoughts?

 ext4_put_super()
  flush_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work)
  destroy_workqueue(sbi->rsv_conversion_wq)

  ext4_journal_destroy()
   /* trigger a commit (it will commit the last trnasaction) */

                    **kjournald2**
                    jbd2_journal_commit_transaction()
                    ...
                     ext4_inode_error()
                      schedule_work(s_sb_upd_work))

                                     **workqueue**
                                      update_super_work()
                                        jbd2_journal_start(journal)
                                          start_this_handle()
                                          //This new trans will
                                          //not be committed.

                     jbd2_journal_abort()

   /* wait for it to complete */

   flush_work(&sbi->s_sb_upd_work)
   jbd2_journal_destroy()
    journal->j_flags |= JBD2_UNMOUNT;
   jbd2_journal_commit_transaction() //it will commit nothing

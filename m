Hi Yafang,

the data itself is available on cgroup v2 in memory.stat:sock, however
you're right, it's charged on pair with other types of memory. It was
one of the main principles of cgroup v2's memory controller, so I don't
think it can be changed.

So the feature you need is not skmem accounting, but something quite
opposite :)

The question I have here: what makes socket memory different here?

Is it something specific to your setup (e.g. you mostly use memory.max
to protect against memory leaks in the userspace code, but socket memory
spikes are always caused by external traffic and are legit) or we have
more fundamental problems with the socket memory handling, e.g. we can't
effectively reclaim it under the memory pressure?

In the first case you can maintain a ~2-lines non-upstream patch which will
disable the charging while maintaining statistics - it's not a perfect, but
likely the best option here. In the second case we need collectively fix it
for cgroup v2.

Thanks!

In other words, this approach blocks all threads from the same process.

cred_alloc_blank() was designed to avoid dealing with -ENOMEM, which is
a required property for this Landlock TSYNC feature (i.e. atomic and
consistent synchronization).

I think it would make sense to replace most of the
key_change_session_keyring() code with a new cred_transfer() helper that
will memcpy the old cred to the new, increment the appropriate ref
counters, and call security_transfer_creds().  We could then use this
helper in Landlock too.

To properly handle race conditions with a thread changing its own
credentials, we would need a new LSM hook called by commit_creds().
For the Landlock implementation, this hook would check if the process is
being Landlocked+TSYNC and return -ERESTARTNOINTR if it is the case.
The newly created task_work would then be free to update each thread's
credentials while only blocking the calling thread (which is also a
required feature).

Alternatively, instead of a new LSM hook, commit_creds() could check
itself a new group leader's flag set if all the credentials from the
calling process are being updated, and return -ERESTARTNOINTR in this
case.

This would not work because the kernel (including LSM hooks) uses
credentials to check access.

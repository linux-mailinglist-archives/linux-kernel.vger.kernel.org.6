I am trying to figure out a meticulous way to verify if the priority really work
or not, all we're here is talk abou like the 'technically', we'd show the
statistic data collected. Except that the stress-ng to stress massive interrupts
to the cpu0, another way I can see is a kmod to remote cross cpu call targeting
the cpu0 from other cpus. From the current data collected, I do see some gain of
latency, still it's not finalized yet. Be patient baby :)

As a said before in this eamil, real statistic data is needed as evaluation,
WIP through now.

I realize, but it will be better if you can point is there any other OS
kernels make use of these interrupt priority of GIC but Linux, if no then
what the rational is for GIC to support these priority features...

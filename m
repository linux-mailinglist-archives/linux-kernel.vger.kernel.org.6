Thank you for reply.

In case that EL3 firmware not support SMCCC TRNG, host and guest can only
get randomness from DRBG-based RNDRRS, right?

In this case, guest get DRBG-based randomness via HVC and host, but the
randomness returned by host kvm is not really backed by EL3 SMCCC TRNG,
and actually get from DRBG-based RNDRRS.
Is this hvc process is redundancy?

Thanks.

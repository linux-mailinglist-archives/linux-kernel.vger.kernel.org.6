I've asked for clock and ideally pinctrl support before merging it. We
had a conversation about the usefulness etc of some of the initial
devicetrees merged for some platforms a few months back, that lead to me
not merging the k230 support I had queued up. I know this isn't exactly
a "fair" barrier to entry, as it is likely that platforms supported by
hobbyists are going to be more affected than companies that usually come
with that basic level, but have to draw a line somewhere.
Both clock and pinctrl are currently in progress for the k1, hopefully
wont take too much longer before this is mergeable.

In other news, nobody has really made an "official" statement about who
is going to maintain this particular platform. People have expressed
interest (including the submitter of the series, IIRC) but there's no
MAINTAINERS entry added here AFAICT. I used to have an entry that
covered arch/riscv/boot/dts/*, with exclusions for sunxi and renesas,
but with Drew taking on thead and sophgo being the res=E3=81=BDonsibility of
Chen Wang and Inochi, I no longer have that wildcard.

I'm happy to apply patches for the platform if noone else is interested
in that side of things, provided there are willing reviewers, but I
would much rather that someone else took up the responsibility of
applying patches and sending PRs - and of course I am happy to help
whoever that is with the process.

Cheers,
Conor.

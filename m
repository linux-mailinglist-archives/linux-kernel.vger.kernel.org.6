This new part is only to address the issue you raised in this thread:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/op.2ndsydgywjvjmi@hhuan26-mobl.amr.corp.intel.com/

Really it has nothing to do whether global, direct/async, per-cgroup  
contexts. They all should use the function the same way. This paragraph  
describes the design and
I thought the above new statements justify the reason we return 'next' so  
it can reclaim into descedant in round-robin fashion?  No sure we need get  
into details of different usages of the functions which are in code  
actually?

I'll address the new global reclamation behavior later when this function  
was actually used for that. And the difference really exists before and  
not because of this change.

Note, all sgx_cgroup_reclaim_pages() guarantees is scanning SGX_NR_TO_SCAN  
pages.

we still reclaim in sgx_cg in first scan and attempt of reclaiming for  
SGX_NR_TOS_CAN pages, but if it turns out that did not satisfy caller  
needs, then caller goes on to reclaim from descendants by passing in  
'next' as starting point.

Again, this is to fix the issue you raised. I consider it improved

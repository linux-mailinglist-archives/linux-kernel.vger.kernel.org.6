So thats the issue here. If we did end up with registers and sequences 
different for controller versions, the ctrl layer was expected to just 
call a reset() op for example similar to the DPU example you gave. And 
as you rightly noted, the dpu_hw_xxx files only expose the ops based on 
version and the upper layers were supposed to just call into the ops 
without knowing the register level details. Thats pretty much what 
dp_ctrl tried to do here. We did not want to expose all the register 
defines in those layers. This series is doing exactly opposite of that.

Not exactly. Why should dp_ctrl really know that some register offset or 
some block shift happened for example. It only needs to know when to 
reset the hardware and not how. Thats the separation getting broken with 
this.

I have not checked your comment on that series here but if your concern 
is stream_id should not be stored in the catalog but just passed, thats 
fine, we can change it. stream_id as a param is needed anyway because 
the register programming layer needs to know which offset to use. This 
series is not mitigating that fact.

The dpu_hw_catalog.c and the dp_catalog.c are not the right files to 
compare with each other. dp_catalog.c should be compared with 
dpu_hw_xxx.c and as you noted, DPU version dependencies are handled in 
those files only and not all over the files like what this series is doing.

Thats the issue here. DPU hardware blocks are arranged according to the 
sub-blocks both in the software interface document and hence the code 
matches it file-by-file. DP registers are grouped by clock domains and 
the file separation we have today does not match that anyway. Hence 
grouping link registers writes or pixel clock register writes into 
dp_ctrl is also not correct that way. Let catalog handle that separation 
internally which it already does.

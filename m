I'd be happy to expose fields from PMSIDR_EL1.

I don't believe that's right.

PMSIDR_EL1.LDS indicates that the loaded data source field is
implemented, but even when it is implemented, the format is
IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED.

Today, Arm Ltd implementations happen to share a format, but that isn't
implied by PMSIDR_EL1.LDS, and there's no guarantee that future CPUs
will all use the same format.

For the moment we'll have to keep adding to this list.

Mark.

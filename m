Well, we should not ignore any failures, just look at
evsel__open_strerror(), we get some error from the kernel, we know we're
doing something, we put it into context, and then we try to provide the
most helpful message to the user.

The question here is how to figure out if what we want to do (sample)
makes sense for this event that has the name we used, since we're using
a "wildcard", a "well known event name" that should be translated to
events in all PMUs where it "matches", if those actual per-PMU events
can provide what the user is asking.

My suggestion about using pr_debug() is a compromise, one that will not
show warnings all the time for such a common case (cycles) while
allowing the use to follow a common, in tools/perf, way of diagnosing
when things don't look sane, which is to ask for verbose mode.

The best thing would be for us to be able to query, using existing
facilities, if what we want is possible, i.e. interpret the error coming
from the kernel in the context of what we are asking.

If this is not possible because the error is too generic (EINVAL) and
can map to multiple other things, then we can try to have a new kernel
facility for us to get this info in a authoritative way and use a
pr_warning() knowing that that warning will go away as the kernel is
updated.

Or we could use a big hammer, special handling some PMUs/events we know
can't sample and avoiding those when they fail, ugly, but should work,
and this is just for this "well known event names" people have been
using since forever. Those wanting specific events to be used should
know better and specify it precisely in the command line.

Does this sum up all the discussion so far?

Cheers,

Yes, I thought that this was an acceptable limitation of the accounting.
If that is not the case then it is really preferable to mention reasons
in the changelog. The reasoning was that hugetlb controller which would
be a natural source of that information is not really great because of
an overhead which hasn't really been evaluated - hence my questioning.

Please add this information into the changelog.

Well, as mentioned in the previous response this has been an acceptable
limitation of the hugetlb accounting. It is fair to reconsider this
based on existing experience but that should be a part of the changelog.

I am sorry but I do not understand the overkill part of the argument.
Is there any runtime or configuration cost that is visible?

Exactly! And this is a problem.

yes, not only shown but also accounted only if the feature is enabled
because we do not want to introduce any (even tiny) overhead for feature
that is not enabled.

TL;DR
1) you need to make the stats accounting aligned with the existing
   charge accounting.
2) make the stat visible only when feature is enabled
3) work more on the justification - i.e. changelog part and give us a
   better insight why a) hugetlb cgroup is seen is a bad choice and b) why
   the original limitation hasn't proven good since the feature was
   introduced.

Makes sense?

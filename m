Oh wait, I think they are probably in the swap slot cache waiting to be freed.
Once the count goes to 0 (inc SWAP_HAS_CACHE), __swap_entry_free_locked
temporarily adds SWAP_HAS_CACHE back in, and free_swap_slot() is called. The
entry is buffered in that layer until the buffer is full and they are all
flushed together. So should be able to trigger that flush to free some slots.

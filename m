It's up to the owner of the page how they want to manage freeing it.
They can use a refcount (folios will still have a refcount, for example),
or they can know when there are no more users of the page (eg slab knows
when all objects in a slab are freed).  RCU is a possibility, but would
be quite unusual I would think.  The model I'm looking for here is that
'page' is too low-level an object to have its own lifecycle; it's always
defined by a higher level object.

Did I advise using put_page() over free_page()?  I hope I didn't say
that.  I don't see a reason why binder needs to refcount its pages (nor
use a mapcount on them), but I don't fully understand binder so maybe
it does need a refcount.

I don't want Page to have a refcount.  If you need something with a
refcount, it needs to be called something else.

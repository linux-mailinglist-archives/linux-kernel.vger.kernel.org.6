Side question here. The standard for an acceptable chip driver is pretty
high (and rightfully so). But a common use case centres around readonly
display of information: temp/fan/in readings. Even just 2-3 readings are
better than nothing.

Example, I still have to use Frank's out of tree it87 for my IT8688.
It works perfectly fine for me, but still not possible to merge that
device into hwmon's it87.
This IT8625 is another example. The NCT6701D-R will be one more shortly.

A readonly driver that is configurable from userspace would help in that
use case. It can be configured for known devices without datasheets or
for testing new devices. Wouldn't even need to access superio config
space.

Filesystem has fuse, i2c has i2c-dev, input has evdev, ...
Would something similar be acceptable for hwmon?

Ah, sorry, I wasn't precise enough in my earlier response to
Diederik...  My research that I referred to was about the OPP nodes
in various dts(i) files, for which there seems to be no preferred
or commonly used layout.

For other nodes, in most cases it's much better to have separator
lines, because they represent different things, which also seems to
be the preferred layout used in most places.

Agreed.  We'd need to patch a few additional RK3399 files otherwise,
because we'd then need to add separator lines into other RK3399 files
as well...  Inconsistency is also not so great. :)

Ah, totally understood. :)

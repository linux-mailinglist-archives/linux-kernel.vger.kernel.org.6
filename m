Just to be clear on what the style issue is. We already have code:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools-next.git/tr=
ee/tools/perf/builtin-record.c?h=3Dperf-tools-next#n1461
```
if (rec->buildid_all && !rec->timestamp_boundary)
    rec->tool.sample =3D NULL;
```
that relies on the special behavior of NULL in a function pointer
being changed at dispatch time - a simple reading of that code would
be anyone calling the function pointer would get a segv. I'm trying to
make it so that NULL isn't magic in the context of tool and you can
simply look at the tool to understand what its behavior is, much as a
virtual method table would work if we could do proper object-oriented
development.

As I checked, if the drm/gfx driver allocates the page for drm, then 
this reserved-memory region is not required.

PRR_CFG_*ADDR regs have read and write access in EL1 only for this 
device, behavior is same as other devices as well. These are not
programmed by fw.

As mentioned above reserved-memory region is not required if gfx/drm
allocates the page.

Yes, from SMMU block perspective PRR bit is present for ACTLR register
on targets with MMU-500, so feature support is available. So I think we 
can just use the mmu-500 compatible string.

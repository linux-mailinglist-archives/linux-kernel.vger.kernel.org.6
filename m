Maybe we're talking past each other...

You asked why this wouldn't work:

  e.g. for ipc-1, ipc-2 and ipc-4 (so no ipc-0 and ipc-3):
  mboxes = <&apcs 13>, <&apcs 9>, <&apcs 19>;

How would we know that the 3rd mailbox (&apcs 19) is for the 4th host
(previous ipc-4)?

1. If we use mboxes with indexes we'd need to have <0> values for
"smsm hosts" where we don't have a mailbox for - this is at least
for the 2nd smsm host (qcom,ipc-2) for a bunch of SoCs.

2. If we use mboxes with mbox-names then we could skip that since we
can directly specify which "smsm host" a given mailbox is for.

My only question really is whether 1. or 2. is a better idea.

Is this clearer now or still not?

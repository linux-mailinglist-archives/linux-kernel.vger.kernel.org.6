Seems reasonable without this story ;-) I get that this is here because
of query np.

I would consider fixes tag for this even! I think it can be
classified as a minor bug. I implemented this feature together
with James Bottomley so would be nice to get some feedback
also from him (as a sanity check)>

Just as a tip: if you put stuff here like supplemental commets the won't
get included when the commit is finally applied (also a popular place
for change log).

Can you send v2 with fixes tag and James as cc.

Since you have such a long cover letter you could possibly:

git format-patch -1 -v2 --cover-letter

Then just move that text in front to 00/01.

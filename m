I still don't get why one of the goals seems to be to artificially
separate AMD Confidential Computing from Intel (and now Arm and RISC-
V).

You say "unify behind", but this proposal doesn't include AMD and it
could easily.  All these RTMR systems are simply subsets of a TPM
functionality with non-standard (and different between each of them)
quoting mechanisms.  The only real substantive difference between RTMR
systems and TPM2 is the lack of algorithm agility.  If everyone is
determined to repeat the mistakes of history, TPM2 can easily be
exposed with a pejorative algorithm, so it could fit into this
structure with whatever the chosen hash is and definitely should be so
the interface can really become a universal one applying to both Intel
*and* AMD.

The only real argument against adding a TPM that I've seen is that it
potentially expands the use beyond confidential VMs, which, in an
interface claiming to be universal, I think is actually a good thing. 
There are many non-CC use cases that would really like a non-repudiable
logging system.

Just on algorithm agility, could I make one more plea to add it to the
API before it's set in stone.  You might think sha384 will last
forever, but then that's what the TPM1 makers thought of sha1 and that
design decision hasn't been well supported by history.  The proposal is
here:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-coco/86e6659bc8dd135491dc34bdb247caf05d8d2ad8.camel@HansenPartnership.com/

Worst case is I'm wrong and you're right and we have an additional
directory in the configfs tree (and you never get to see my tiktok I
told you so dance).  But if I'm right, we've got algorithm agility
(especially if post-quantum has some impact on hashes that hasn't been
foreseen) built in from the get go instead of having to be welded on
after the fact when we run into problems.

All I need at this stage is crypto agility in the configfs ABI.  I can
add vTPM code to that without anyone at Intel having to worry about it.

Regards,

James

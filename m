RISC-V does want to support legacy events as that's how users on other
architectures are used to
run perf. It would be weird if we don't support it.

Our initial reasoning behind relying on json for legacy events to
avoid vendor specific encodings for these
events in the driver. Unlike other ISAs, RISC-V ISA doesn't define an
event encoding for these legacy
events. As a result every platform vendor will have custom encoding.
Managing them in the driver is
cumbersome. Many thanks to Ian for posting the patches to reverse the
priority which works fine for RISC-V.

However, I understand that it is easier said than done and some use
cases are broken. We also discovered
there are few other use cases which still have the same problem even
if we solve the bigger problem via json parsing
for legacy events.

1. Any other user profiling application that invokes perf system calls
directly may also try to just legacy event attributes in
perf_event_attr.
Android simpleperf application also falls in this category. We need to
describe the platform specific encoding somewhere for these
applications.

2. Perf running inside guests may run on any hardware and can't be
tied to a platform specific json file. If we bind the legacy
events via json file, those users won't be able to use perf cycle or
instruction without the json file available.

I don't have any good solutions for the above said problems without
specifying the encoding in the driver itself.
Given all the problems around json parsing for legacy events, we are
thinking of biting the bullet and allowing platform vendors
to encode the legacy events in the driver itself similar to other
ISAs. We will try to keep the interface as scalable as possible.

Any suggestions ?

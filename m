The race and warning pointed out in the changelog might have been
sufficiently mitigated by this more recent commit:

commit 1378b37d03e8147c67fde60caf0474ea879163d8
Author: Yafang Shao <laoar.shao@gmail.com>
Date:   Thu Aug 6 23:22:08 2020 -0700

    memcg, oom: check memcg margin for parallel oom

If not, another possibility would be this:

	ret = tsk_is_oom_victim(task) || out_of_memory(&oc);

But we should probably first restore reliable forward progress on
dying tasks, then worry about the spurious printk later.

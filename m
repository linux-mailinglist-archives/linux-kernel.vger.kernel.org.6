What was happening was, we enumerated to HS200, but then cqe error was
triggered and this re-triggers the tuning algo repeatedly until the
failing region was found.

After thinking about this some more, I think I will switch to dev_dbg,
if we fail to find failing region and we re-run the tuning algorithm,
don't want to confuse people by printing error logs if we are re-running
the tuning algo anyways. Thanks so much for your feedback!

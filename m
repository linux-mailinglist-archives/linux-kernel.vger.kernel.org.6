Hi Victor,

Basically I have been prioritizing my review bandwidth. I have already
spent a lot of time reviewing and helping to move this series forward,
but I am simply worried that I will be wasting bandwidth if/when I am
looking into this again.

That said, I will await for you to send another new version to address
Adrian's final comments for the sdhci parts. Then I will try to review
it one more time.

Kind regards
Uffe

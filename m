After finally going through the v1 discussion [4] in detail,
here are my further thoughts:

- I agree with dropping the Diodes stuff, [5] because I see
   no need for that at this point;  though, am I missing
   something, where are they actually used?

- I agree that "enable-gpios" and "vdd-supply" should be
   required in the binding, [5] because that's the basis for
   something to be actually represented this way

- I agree that it should be better not to touch fixed-clock
   at this point, simply because it's used in very many places,
   and because in this case we need more than it requires (see
   the bullet point above)

- As I wrote already, [6] I highly disagree with this being
   called voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), [7] simply
   because it isn't a VCO, but a clock that can be gated;
   though, looking forward to what the last bullet point
   asks to be clarified further

- I still think that gated-clock is the best choice for the
   name, because it uses "clock" that's used throughout the
   entire codebase, and uses "gated" to reflect the nature
   of the clock generator

- Maybe we could actually use fixed-gated-clock as the name,
   which would make more sense from the stanpoint of possibly
   merging it into fixed-clock at some point, but I'd like
   to hear first what's actually going on with the Diodes
   stuff that was deleted in v2, which I already asked about
   in the first bullet point

Right, so with Google doing their own chips, I think you stand a fair
chance of making it work 'soon', right? :-)

Right, so if we really want to go do this, we should add place-holder
state for suspend, something like CPUHP_SUSPEND and document the
requirements and audit all existing states now skipped to meet
requirements.

I think it should go somewhere right between CPUHP_BP_PREPARE_DYN_END
and CPUHP_BRINGUP_CPU. WORKQUEUE_PREP seems awefully random, and the
typical purpose of the _PREPARE stages is to allocate memory/resources
such that STARTING can do its thing, similarly _DEAD is about freeing
resources that got unused during _DYING.

So the most logical setup would be to skip the entire _DEAD/_PREPARE
cycle.

So I'm not sure you can actually skip this during hibernate. The thing
is, we load the image from the boot CPU in a state where the secondary
CPUs have never yet been loaded up. It might be possible to skip the
DEAD/PREPARE cycle, but it would also mean the image must contain the
full PREPARE resources. So if it all works, then the result is a larger
image, for a slightly faster cycle, but since hibernate is already super
slow, I don't think this trade-off is worth it.

Agreed, it is correct to avoid serious problems by judging the split,

I was thinking that it is wrong to report no error or hint when split == 0.

Totally agree! These printouts are very useful for debugging.

The modification above looks good. I tested it and it works fine.

But I think we could reuse the error handling code like this:

I think it's very helpful.

Thank you very much for your detailed explanation!

Do you mean changing the PMU's name in the driver? I can't imagine that 
would go down too well given how long it's been there. Seems to me 
there's too much risk of it breaking some other tool or script. It would 
be a bit unfair to do that to fix an assumption that only really exists 
in Perf, and especially if there could be other ways to achieve the same 
behaviour in Perf.

I think tools like this are always going to be full of various 
heuristics and magic to make the experience as user friendly as 
possible. If using the bare kernel interface was already fully featured 
enough then there wouldn't be a need for Perf to exist.

In an ideal world we'd have some capability file like you mentioned 
above. Or a folder with symlink to other instances of the same PMU then 
a tool can follow the links to other PMUs to deduplicate them. In theory 
we could add that right now. At least it wouldn't depend on any name 
restrictions, but it does push complexity that should probably exist in 
a tool into the kernel. In practice I think it would be a bit of a 
nightmare because it has to be re-implemented for everyone's PMU driver. 
That's got to be more code than tools doing it on the list of events 
produced.

I think at this point we could even consider a whitelist of known PMU 
names and how each one behaves. It's probably less than a handful long.

I'm interested in quantifying this time if we do any of these changes.

Is this particular example of 100s of PMUs with mrvl_ddr_pmu? How many 
events does it have? And which particular uses cases are most important, 
is it just listing or opening events? From what I can see these 
proposals shouldn't actually effect opening events, and you'd think 
listing could take a small time hit as it's done less frequently than 
opening. And there's already a lot of output.

Is this an issue in this case? If we're talking about listing events, 
then we show the single deduplicated instance as it is now. With an 
empty events folder nothing is lost.

Well, I was considering what would happen if we always apply this 
deduplication without taking suffixes into account. The suffix rule just 
becomes a bit of a premature optimization to avoid reading the events 
folder in some cases, but if we make it acceptably fast all PMUs 
regardless of name could be considered for deduplication.

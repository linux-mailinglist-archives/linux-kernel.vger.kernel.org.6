Correct, I was meaning that TPM could be built as a module and since we 
were extending its public interface, the thought is it would be proper 
for us to make it exported. We have no requirement for it to be export 
for our usage.

Right, sorry. As I recall, that was introduce due to the sequence of how 
the TPM driver handled locality, moving back to Locality 0 after done 
sending cmds. In the Oracle implementation, the initramfs takes 
integrity measurements of the environment it is about to kexec into, eg. 
target kernel, initramfs, file system, etc. Some of these measurements 
should go into PCR 17 and PCR 18, which requires Locality 2 to be able 
extend those PCRs. If the slmodule is able to set the locality for all 
PCR extends coming from user space to be Locality 2, that removes the 
current need for it.

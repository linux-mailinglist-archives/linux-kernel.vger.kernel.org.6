Sorry if I missed the rationale for the split here from the previous
discussions, but I would like to see the DT bindings if any for all the
users first before I can merge this. I am happy to get this series reviewed
independently but my views might change looking at how it will be used as
I might get better idea looking at the users. I really don't like the
interface as well as the DT bindings that might be enforcing us to define.
I have given my initial comments there.

No need to respin it together immediately or even in future as along as
there is a reference for me to look at.

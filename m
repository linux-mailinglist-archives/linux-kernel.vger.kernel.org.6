Yes, we don't need to.  Nonetheless, calling ->prepare_access_checks() is also
not a big problem, right?  If I'm not wrong, I don't want to add more
complexity for unclear benefit.  In other words, I think simply letting a
kdamond continues access monitoring for virtual address space targets even
after the processes are terminated while there are other contexts that need to
continue access monitoring is ok, unless it has clear and significant problem.

If this is really needed, why don't you simply call ->target_valid() for each
target for whenever we need to know if the target is valid?

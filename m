Hi Marc,

Sorry for the delay in response, I was looking at nested virt and
migration changes so that I can get your feedback on those.

Lazily allocating MTE-capable memory requires changes to different
kernel subsystems and previous attempts got dropped [1] because it
was not clear whether the benefit of saving 3% memory overhead was worth
the complexity we add to the kernel.

This patchset is not looking at that feature. Instead, it can be used to
enable MTE in configurations that currently won't allow MTE. One such
example is libkrun which includes linux kernel as firmware in a
dynamically linked library (libkrunfw). libkrun can insert the kernel
region which got mmaped as part of the library load, directly into the
guest memory map instead of copying the kernel. Such a guest config
can't enable MTE currently even though we will never use the newly
inserted memory regions as tag access memory.

Similarly, virtiofs dax support can use a page cache region as
virtio-shm region. We can use MTE_PERM to enable MTE in this config.

I am sorry that i am not able to follow you here. I am confused whether
your feedback is related to the use of MemAttr[3:0] values or w.r.t
the usage of KVM_PGTABLE_PROT_NORMAL_NOTAG_ACCESS. If you can explain
more on how you would like to see the changes I can incorporate them in
the next update.

With migration, I guess i can prevent migration to a target that doesn't
support FEAT_MTE_PERM by updating set_one_reg to check for the feature
support. Something like this

For nested virtualization, I guess it is useful to support this for
nested guest. This implies L2 stage2 in L1 will have to support
Normal,NoTagAccess attribute. ie,

in L0 kvm, if the guest abort is on a nested smmu, then we walk the L2
stage2 in L1 and see if the memory attribute is NoTagAccess. If yes
we inject a s2 fault to L1. Do you agree this is a good design?

I's a set of PCR values pcrlock predicts, one or more for each PCR. It
then compiles a TPM "policy" from that, which is identified by a hash,
and that hash is then stored in a TPM "nvindex" (which is a bit of
memory a tpm provides).

Well, a kexec *should* affect some PCRs. Replacement of the kernel
*must* be visible in the measurement logs somehow, in a predictable
fashion.

Well, it's not systemd that checks that, but the TPM. i.e. not the
untrusted OS but the the suppedly more trusted TPM.

So, key is that we want that measurements take place, the kexec
operation *must* be made visible in the measurement logs. But it must
be in a well-defined way, and ideally as an extension of the
measurements sd-stub currently makes.

(BTW, I personally don't think emulating EFI is really that
important. As long as we get the key functionality that sd-stub
provides also when doing kexec I am happy. i.e. whether it is sd-stub
that does this or some other piece of code doesn't really matter to
me. What I do care about is that we can parameterize the invoked
kernel in a similar fashion as we can parameterize sd-stub, and that
the measurements applied are also equivalent.)

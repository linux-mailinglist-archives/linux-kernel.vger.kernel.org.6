Thanks, I think this would be good. The biggest issue is that none of
the record logic expects a file descriptor to be not opened, deleting
unopened evsels from the evlist breaks all the indexing into the
mmaps, etc. Tbh, you probably wouldn't do the code this way if was
written afresh. Perhaps a hashmap would map from an evsel to ring
buffer mmaps, etc. Trying to avoid having global state and benefitting
from encapsulation. I'd focus on just doing the expedient thing in the
changes, which probably just means making the record code tolerant of
evsels that fail to open and not modifying the evlist due to the risk
it breaks the indices.

(To point out the obvious, this work wouldn't be necessary if arm_dsu
event were renamed from "cycles" to "cpu_cycles" which would also make
it more intention revealing alongside the arm_dsu's "bus_cycles" event
name).

So I think your later emails clarify Arnaldo is probably missing:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools-next.git/co=
mmit/drivers/perf/arm_pmu.c?h=3Dperf-tools-next&id=3D5c816728651ae425954542=
fed64d21d40cb75a9f

Fwiw, the Apple M hardware issue came to me by way of Mark Rutland
(iirc), this regression report, etc. My understanding is that Apple M
has something like a v2 ARM PMU and the legacy events are encoded
incorrectly in the driver for this. The regression in v6.5 happened
because ARM's core PMUs had previously been treated as uncore PMUs,
meaning we wouldn't try to program legacy events on them. Fixing the
handling of ARM's core PMUs broke Apple M due to the broken legacy
event mappings. Why not fix the Apple M PMU driver? Well there was
anyway a similar RISC-V issue reported by Atish Patra (iirc) where the
RISC-V PMU driver wants to delegate the mapping of legacy events to
the perf tool so the driver needn't be aware of all and future RISC-V
configurations. The fix discussed with Mark, Atish, etc. has been to
swap the priority of legacy and sysfs/json events so that the latter
has priority. We need the revert of the revert as currently we only do
this if a PMU is specified with an event, not for the general wildcard
PMUs case that most people use. There was huge fallout from flipping
the priority particularly on Intel as all test expectations needed
updating. I've sent out similar fixes that need incorporating when the
revert is reverted. Ideally tools/perf/tests/parse-events.c would be
updated to cover ARM's PMUs that don't follow the normal pattern that
the core PMU is called "cpu" (this would mean that we were testing
event parsing on ARM was WAI wrt encoding priorities, BIG.little,
etc).

I'd prefer we didn't merge this as we'd need to rebase:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240510053705.2462258-4-irogers@google.com/
and those changes would then delete the code introduced. I'm fine with
adding the tests.

There are more exotic heterogeneous core things upcoming, probably
also from ARM, and the thought of duplicating the default attribute
logic and event parsing constraints is just something I'd prefer not
to have to do.

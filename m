Please see my posted fix in this thread. Things "broke" quite a bit
more widely than anticipated.

It's been a dtc warning since 2007, so I can say all of the in tree
dts's are fine. The problem for these reported platforms is the
kernel, not the DT.

I find that pr_warn() may or may not get noticed, but WARN for sure
will which is what I want here.

As far as online scaning is concerned, if you are using LVM, we can
use a combination of dm-snapshot and e2fsck -fn --- that is what the
e2scrub command automates.

Online fsck is much harder, since it would require back pointers to do
this efficienctly.  To do this, a general way of solving this would
involve a generalized some kind of b-tree or b+tree where changes are
managed via jbd2.  This could be used so that (for example) if we had
a tree which maps block ranges to an inode number, then given a block
number, we can figure out which inode "owns" that block.  The harder
part is those objects that have multiple forward pointers --- for
example an inode might have multiple hard links to multiple
directories, so we need to handle this somehow.

If we had the jbd2-aware b+tree, we could also use this add support
for reflink/clone, which would also be cool.

If this is something that your team really weants to work on, what I'd
suggest is to create a rough design of what the journaled b+tree would
look like, and then implement it first, since this is the prerequisite
for a huge number of advanced file system features.  Implementation
should be done in a way that makes it easy for the code to be usable
both in the kernel and in e2fsprogs, since life will be much easier if
we have e2fsck and debugfs support for the new file system data
structures from the very beginning of the development.

If your company is willing to invest in the engineering effort to do
this, great!  But I have to point out that an alternative approach
that you should consider is whether XFS might be a closer match for
some of your customers' needs.  The advantage of ext4 is that it is
much simpler and easier to understand that XFS.  But as we add these
new features, ext4 will get more complex.  And so one of the design
considerations we should keep in mind is to keep ext4 as simple and
miantainable as possible, even as we add new functionality.

Cheers,

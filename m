That "determine @id of @d at rr->r->mon_display_scope" is:

	display_id = get_domain_id_from_scope(cpumask_first(rr->d->hdr.cpu_mask), rr->r->mon_display_scope);
	if (display_id < 0) {
		take some error action
	}

So it certainly isn't *required* to carry display_id around. But doing
so makes the code simpler. I could bury the long line into a helper
macro/function. But I can't bury the error check.

I'd also need to change get_domain_id_from_scope() from "static" to
global so it can be used in other files besides core.c

Note that there are several places where I need to use display_id,
computing it at run time in each place, but it seems so much easier to
do it once at domain creation time.

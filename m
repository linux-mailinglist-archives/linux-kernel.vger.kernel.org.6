AFAIK this can safely be added to the drivers .dev_groups. The driver core=
 will ensure that
those sysfs attrs are registers after the drivers .probe callback returned=

Please also handle the case here value is zero. You can for example return=

The error handling is a bit strange.

Please try to set the default platform profile first before registering th=
e platform profile interface,
then register the platform profile interface and use devm_add_action_or_re=
set().

This is the exact reason why i think this should be done in userspace. You=
 can replace this code
with a simple input event submission using the KBDILLUM* key codes. This w=
ould also allow you to
avoid any special locking in this case.

This would also allow userspace to configure the step with of the brightne=
ss changes.

Please add some locking here, the value of "allow recording" might have be=

You should initialize the input device before registering the i8042 filter=
 and the ACPI notify handler,
or else they might try to submit input events on a allocated but not-yet-r=
egistered input device.

Also please call galaxybook_enable_acpi_notify() after registering the inp=
ut device.

See checkpatch for complains about this. Also i would prefer if you drop t=

You can also just store pdev->dev and the ACPI handle here.

When using .dev_groups the driver core will registers those after the prob=
e callback returns, so please
use .dev_groups.

Does installing the i8042 filter involve any IO? If no then please fail pr=
obing if an error
occurs here.

I think with would make sense to do this printing inside the initializatio=
n functions. They can also
return 0 instead of an error when they determine that the feature is simpl=
y not available on a given machine
so that all real errors can be treated as such and result in an probe fail=
ure.

I think the dell-wmi-ddv driver does something similar.

Maybe you should also use devres for this, since this will only get called=
 if the previous
probe callback was successful.

In general i am very positive about this driver. Nearly all issues are rat=
her small, so i am
looking forward to the v4 patch series :).

I don't believe there's a way to do that on running kernels. As Jan
pointed out, this cannot be done during reboot, as for kdump that would
mean to run after a panic. So it would need to run when the new image
is loaded. But at that time your user space is running. Plus you also
always have a user space component that triggers kexec. So you cannot
simply "zap" user space but have to somehow stash it away, run your
trusted user space and, then restore the old user space again. That
sounds pretty error prone to me. Plus it will tank your performance
every time you do a kexec, which for kdump is every boot...

Well, in theory that should work. But I see several problems:

1) How does the first kernel tell the intermediate kernel which
file(s) with wich command line to load? In fact, how does the first
kernel get the information itself? You would need a new system call
that takes two kernel images, one for the intermediate and one for the
kernel to load,for that.

Of course you could also build the intermediate UKI during kernel build
and include it into the image. Similar to what is done with the
purgatory. But that would totally bloat the kernel image. 

2) I expect that to be extremely painful to debug, if the intermediate
kernel runs into a panic. For sure kdump won't work in that case...

3) Distros would need maintain and test the additional UKI.

4) This approach basically needs to boot twice. But there are people
out there who fight to reduce boot times extremely hard. For them every
millisecond counts. Telling them that they will need to wait twice as
long will be very hard to sell.

I don't believe we can simply take all those payloads and recompile
them to eBPF. There definitely needs to be some refactoring done first.
For example the IO loops you can drop for eBPF and simply map to the
corresponding kernel function, letting them do the full IO in one go.
There will be cases where that will be more difficult like for hash
loops when you have to have the same hash at the end. But I believe
even for that ways could be found to get it to work.

Anyway, I'm sure that the picture I have in my head is way
oversimplified. There will be many pitfalls to handle for sure. Still I
believe it would be a nice experiment.

Thanks
Philipp

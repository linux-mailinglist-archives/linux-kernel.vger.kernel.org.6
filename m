Yes, there is now block group level isolation. Our goal is to further
reduce the scope of isolation to minimise the impact of isolation.

The rough idea is to isolate resources where errors are reported,
and throw errors when isolation is not possible. This may be a bit
crude, but after implementing inline scanning we can achieve precise
fine-grained isolation.

Indeed, consistency is a tricky issue, and we'll focus on that piece of
logic.

Of course, we have to make sure that the metadata modification and the tree
update are in the same transaction, otherwise there is no guarantee that
the metadata is consistent.

Thank you for your input!

Hi Ard,

The only reason off the top of my head of why it was exported was to 
support the fact that the tpm module itself could be built as a module, 
not that we were looking for it to be done so.

As to sysfs, there is the TXT register content that we would like to 
have exposed, and they should be readonly. For context to contrast with, 
tboot user space utility txt-stat worked by trying to read the TXT 
register address space via /dev/mem, think enough is said there. The 
other purpose we used sysfs was management of the DRTM log. We used it 
to provide a means to ensure the DRTM eventlog is extended when 
measurements are sent to the DRTM PCRs and then to be able to retrieve 
the final log.

v/r,
dps

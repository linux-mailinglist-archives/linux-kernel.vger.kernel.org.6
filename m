Sounds good. At least we have a good understanding now of how this
particular firmware is broken so it would be great if you could use
this as a test case for the implementation.

In summary, we need to force the use of a fast channel for
PERF_LEVEL_GET on these machines, or possibly fall back to the current
behaviour of only using the domain attribute to determine whether the
fast channels should be initialised.

The latter may allow for a less intrusive implementation even if we'd
still see:

	arm-scmi arm-scmi.0.auto: Failed to get FC for protocol 13 [MSG_ID:6 / RES_ID:0] - ret:-95. Using regular messaging.
	arm-scmi arm-scmi.0.auto: Failed to get FC for protocol 13 [MSG_ID:6 / RES_ID:1] - ret:-95. Using regular messaging.
	arm-scmi arm-scmi.0.auto: Failed to get FC for protocol 13 [MSG_ID:6 / RES_ID:2] - ret:-95. Using regular messaging.

when not supported for all messages (e.g. with the current firmware).

I guess only Sibi and Qualcomm can answer that. Both machines I have
that suffer from this report:

	arm-scmi arm-scmi.0.auto: SCMI Protocol v2.0 'Qualcomm:' Firmware version 0x20000

and I'm not sure if any fixed firmware has made it out to the vendors
yet or if the version was bumped when this was fixed.

On the other hand, perhaps forcing fast channel initialisation for
PERF_LEVEL_GET on all 'Qualcomm' firmware would work (i.e. only based on
VENDOR).

Much appreciated, thanks.

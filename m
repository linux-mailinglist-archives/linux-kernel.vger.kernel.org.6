Thanks Robin. The hardware and cache events are legacy events that are
printed here, the assumption being that core PMUs don't use a suffix:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools-next.git/tr=
ee/tools/perf/util/print-events.c?h=3Dperf-tools-next#n304
Fwiw these events are knowingly broken on the Apple M? ARM PMUs as
legacy events like L1-dcache-loads will use a legacy encoding which is
broken on this PMU, hence trying to migrate to preferring sysfs/json
events first - the support for which is reverted in v6.10.
The l3d_cache_wb event is not a legacy event and so goes down the
regular PMU event printing route that tries to avoid listing duplicate
PMUs as there may be 10s or 100s of these:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools-next.git/tr=
ee/tools/perf/util/pmus.c?h=3Dperf-tools-next#n490
Yes, this was an intentional behavior change as system scale has gotten lar=
ger.
I'm currently thinking that the suffix should just be ignored on core
PMUs, we assume they never have duplicates. Unfortunately the code
just has a name and doesn't know from this whether a PMU is core or
not:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/perf/perf-tools-next.git/tr=
ee/tools/perf/util/pmus.c?h=3Dperf-tools-next#n43
Note, following Kan Liang's advice we've been trying to actually
document the PMU naming convention:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20240606044959.335715-1-irogers@google.com/
The inconsistency here comes from ARM core PMUs using suffixes, which
isn't really intended behavior and will likely screw up, my guess is
around legacy events (the tests of which currently have limited ARM
coverage).

Thanks,
Ian

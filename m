yes, agree, it's the user space process's fault after all.

I accidentally found another problem in request_module when i was 
testing this patch again, if the caller just passes a empty pointer to 
request_module, like request_module(NULL), the process will be broken:

[    2.336160]  ? asm_exc_page_fault+0x2b/0x30
[    2.336160]  ? __pfx_crc64_rocksoft_notify+0x10/0x10
[    2.336160]  ? vsnprintf+0x5a/0x4f0
[    2.336160]  __request_module+0x93/0x2b0
[    2.336160]  ? __pfx_crc64_rocksoft_notify+0x10/0x10
[    2.336160]  ? notifier_call_chain+0x65/0xd0
[    2.336160]  ? __pfx_crc64_rocksoft_notify+0x10/0x10
[    2.336160]  crypto_probing_notify+0x43/0x60

(please ignore the caller, that is a testing code.)

I searched kernel code if this patter exists, and found in 
__trace_bprintk of kernel/trace/trace_printk.c, it checks fmt at the 
beginning of the function:

      va_list ap;

      if (unlikely(!fmt))
          return 0;

Therefore, i would like to suggest we should at least add this check in 
request_module too. In that sense, why don't we do a little further to 
verify every parameter's validity to provide better fault tolerance, 
besides, it costs almost nothing.

If you like this idea, i will send a v2.

Many thanks.

Song

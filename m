In term of efficiency, your patch does eliminate the third iteration (k) 
in the csn iteration loop. However the new union_sets() function may go 
up the node hierarchy which can considered a third iteration in some 
way. So there is some saving, but not as significant as it looks. It 
does simplify the code and make it a bit easier to read.

I just constructed some scenarios locally to test, so the testing scope is limited. Thank you for providing the test cases. I have reproduced and resolved the issue, and have passed several other test cases in CGroup. But currently, I only have QEMU simulation environment, so my testing ability is limited. I hope you can help me with some comprehensive testing of my new version patch. Thank you very much.

Also your patch eliminates all the use of the cpuset->pn variable. So 
you cab remove it as it is no longer needed.

After a harder look at the generate_sched_domains() code, I have found a 
bug in the code with respect to the support of remote partition. I will 
send another patch to fix it. I also realize that the function was 
originally designed to support v1 cpuset. v2 cpuset is quite different 
and the code can be simplified for the v2 use case.

You are welcome to send a v4 patch on top of the new cpuset code base.

Thanks,
Longman

That's the case after these changes, but not before.

Agreed, but such things happen in builtin_cmd where the tool is
defined and presumably they know what they are doing. My objection is
to code in util mutating the tool as I want the tool to have
predictable behavior. As callers that take a tool can call fill in
defaults (not all) then the tool has to be mutable and I don't want
this to be the case.

> Really, 'tool' needs to be defined as const in the first place.

I'd like this. The problem is initializing all the function pointers
and making such initialization robust to extra functions being added
to the tool API. It can be done in a long winded way but I couldn't
devise macro magic to do it. The other problem is around variables
like ordered_events that can't currently be const. The patches move us
closer to this being a possibility.

If they do this their function pointers will be clobbered and their
code won't behave as expected, which I'd expect to be easy to observe.
In C++ if you were to initialize memory and then use the memory for a
placement new to create an object which would call the constructor,
the expected behavior would be that the initialized memory's values
would get overridden. I see the use of _init and _exit in the code as
being our poor man replacements of constructors and destructors.

Multiplied by every stub, we'd probably need a helper function, how to
handle argument passing. There's nothing wrong with this as an idea
but I think of this code as trying to create a visitor pattern and
this is a visitor pattern with a hard time for the caller.

It is because the patch series gets rid of fill in defaults which is
why we have a mutable tool passed around. I don't think this is up for
debate as the patch series clearly goes from a non-const
tool to a const tool at the end. Changing perf_tool__init to make all
the function pointers NULL and then making every caller have to do a:

         if (tool->cb)
                 tool->cb(...);
         else
                 cb_stub(...);

I think it is a less elegant solution at the end, it is also a large
and more invasive change. The various refactorings to make tool const,
changing the aux use of tool, etc. wouldn't be impacted by such a
change but I think it is out of scope for this patch series.

Thanks,
Ian

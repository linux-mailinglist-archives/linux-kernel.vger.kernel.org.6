I agree, they are too coarse-grained. From an API perspective, what we
need is an alloc_pages() that takes a DMA mask or phys address limit,
maybe something similar to memblock_alloc_range_nid(). OTOH, an
advantage of the zones is that by default you keep the lower memory free
by using ZONE_NORMAL as default, you have free lists per zone. Maybe
with some alternative data structures we could efficiently search free
pages based on phys ranges or bitmasks and get rid of the zones but I
haven't put any thoughts into it.

We'd still need some boundaries like *_dma_get_max_cpu_address() to at
least allocate an swiotlb buffer that's suitable for all devices.

Indeed, and as Robin mentioned, the ACPI/DT code already handle this.

Looking forward to this. I'll dial in, unfortunately can't make Plumbers
in person this year.

In the meantime, I think this series is a good compromise ;).

As per my understanding since ACTLR register is an implementation
defined register,
so I think the placement can also depend on factor of how these
registers are used?

For Qualcomm SoCs, it stores prefetch values for each client, improving
performance without defining hardware design.
Even without setting this value, clients on these Stream-IDs would still
function, albeit with reduced performance.

The SteamID/Mask pair in first two columns <which is a SoC topology> is
only used as reference to find preferred prefetch setting for the
corresponding client on this StreamID

To refer initial discussion and Robin's thoughts on device-tree approach
for this property which we proposed as a part of RFC:
https://lore.kernel.org/all/a01e7e60-6ead-4a9e-ba90-22a8a6bbd03f@quicinc.com/

So as per the initial discussions it felt right to have this data stored
inside driver.
One potential downside is that the driver file could become cluttered
with this data, but this can be mitigated by storing the table in a
separate file if necessary.

For use cases or vendor that implement the ACTLR register differently,
deeply involving SoC topology values or defining hardware design
(something similar to Stream Matching Register),then it might be more
appropriate to place it in the devicetree?

This is just my understanding. I’d appreciate your further thoughts on 
this - Will, Robin, Dmitry, Rob.

Thanks & regards,

As I said this one is currently handled by assuming TX-done by
depositing in the h/w queue/fifo.
You will have the same perf as with your attempt to have "multiple
in-flight" while neither of these approaches handles in-flight
failures. We can discuss this.

These are nothing new. A few other platforms too have shared channels
and that is implemented above the mailbox.

It is very easy to populate them as separate controllers.

As I already explained, to tie RX to a TX is very protocol specific
and should be done in the layer above the mailbox api.

Thanks.

This issue is not about deciding which IRQ/softIRQ events should be
accounted for. Instead, it focuses on reflecting the interrupted
runtime of a task or a cgroup. I might be misunderstanding the
distinction between *charge* and *account*=E2=80=94or perhaps there is no
difference between them=E2=80=94but PATCH #4 captures exactly what I mean.
While IRQ/softIRQ time should not be attributed to the interrupted
task, it is crucial to have a metric that reflects this interrupted
runtime in CPU utilization.

The purpose of this patchset is to address this issue, conceptually
represented as:

   |<----Runtime---->|<----Interrupted time---->|<----Runtime---->|<---Slee=
p-->|

Without reflecting the *interrupted time* in CPU utilization, a gap=E2=80=
=94or
hole=E2=80=94is created:

    |<----Runtime---->|<----HOLE---->|<----Runtime---->|<---Sleep-->|

This gap will misleadingly appear as sleep time to the user:

  |<----Runtime---->|<----Sleep---->|<----Runtime---->|<---Sleep-->|

As a result, users may interpret this as underutilized CPU time and
attempt to increase their workloads to raise CPU runtime. However,
these efforts will be futile, as the observed runtime cannot increase
due to the missing metric for interrupted time.

The data in question is from cpu.stat. Below is the cpu.stat file for cgrou=
p2:

  $ cat cpu.stat
  usage_usec 0
  user_usec 0
  system_usec 0                            <<<< We should reflect the
interrupted time here.
  core_sched.force_idle_usec 0
  nr_periods 0
  nr_throttled 0
  throttled_usec 0
  nr_bursts 0
  burst_usec 0

I believe I have explained this clearly in the comments above.
However, if anything remains unclear, please feel free to ask for
further clarification.

It is, in fact, a cgroup. These cgroups may be deployed across
different servers.

The issue here is that the global IRQ time may include the interrupted
time of tasks outside the target cgroup. As a result, I don't believe
it's possible to find a reliable solution without modifying the
kernel.

I was referring to whatever the EFI table that James Bottomley mentioned
that I presume the stub loader reads from when the stub loader
constructs the tpm_log that is passed to the kernel.

So I believe we are in agreement of everything except terminology.

If there is no point to having access to it then we should just not
pass anything to the loaded kernel, so the kernel does not think there
is anything there.

I am fine with that.  The complaint I had seen was that the table was
being corrupted and asking how to solve that.  It seems I haven't read
the part of the conversation where it was made clear that no one wants
the tpm_log after kexec.

If someone wants the tpm_log then we need to solve this problem.

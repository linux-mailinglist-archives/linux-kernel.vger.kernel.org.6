I think this patch landed upsteam as d05dcfdf5e16 (" fs/9p: mitigate
inode collisions") and so I can confirm that it doesn't help with the
issue.

FWIW, I'm not using QEMU at all. This is with kvmtool which, for better
or worse, prints no such diagnostic and used to be reliable enough with
whatever magic the kernel had prior to v6.9.

I'm happy to test patches if there's anything available, but otherwise
the reverts at least get us back to the old behaviour if nobody has time
to come up with something better.

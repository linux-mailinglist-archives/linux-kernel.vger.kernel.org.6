I'm not sure if I understood what you've meant by the sdp_map layout
re-use.

Sure. It seems the important parts have been reviewed in the next

Sure :-)

It is typical to have a single file with the full register information.
MDP5 for example also has a single register file.

Even from the register separation point of view: it's better to separate
the AUX and p0/p1 functions rather than keeping them in the dp_catalog.c
together with the rest of the unrelated functions.

Note, that dp_link.c also uses dp_reg.h though it doesn't use dp_catalog
at all.

So you don't need separate swap knobs, only combined, right?

I think that _at least_ we should refactor the code so that it would
be a minimal patch (e.g. one #define) to switch to the old mode.

I don't think it's reasonable to add a new interface, but having a
patch/config option or even a mount option which changes the semantics
of memory.swap.max to the v1-like behavior should be ok.

I'll try to do the first part (refactoring this code), and we can have
a discussion from there.

Thanks!

Sorry for that I don't adjust the comments in architecture code 
referring to the masking.
I've tested the stack entropy by applying this patch on arm64.
before:
Bits of stack entropy: 6
after:
Bits of stack entropy: 7
It seems the difference was minimal, so I didn't reflect it in the 
commit message. Now it appears that I missed some of the Kees's intentions.
Kees has resent the patch, and everything should be fine now.

Thanks!

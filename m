The point I was trying to make here was that there isn't _technically_ 
any user facing bug on Apple M with both a new kernel and new perf, 
despite the issues Mark mentioned.

I think there's a bit more subtlety in Mark's request. Using sysfs is 
only required for old kernels that don't support extended type ID, and 
it's not specific to apple M, that's for everywhere. The other case he 
mentioned was when the events are slightly different but with the same 
name as legacy, which isn't the case here specifically but is already 
fixed by  ("perf parse-events: Make legacy events lower priority than 
sysfs/JSON") (v6.8).

Yep you're right, I got confused with the original bug report which is 
now old. With commit a24d9d9dc ("perf parse-events: Make legacy events 
lower priority than sysfs/JSON") (v6.8) named PMUs do prioritize sysfs.

Just patch 3 here:

I assume it works because we don't open on uncore right now. But I'm 
still rebasing and testing it. So we could merge that, and then when we 
do the priority revert along with the fix to ignore the DSU error it 
will continue to work.

This regression report is for various (admittedly extremely confusing) 
combinations of kernels and perfs without the following patches:

5c81672865 ("arm_pmu: Add PERF_PMU_CAP_EXTENDED_HW_TYPE capability")
    (v6.6 kernel release)

25412c036 ("perf print-events: make is_event_supported() more robust")
    (v6.9 Perf release for Apple M)

a24d9d9dc ("perf parse-events: Make legacy events lower priority than
             sysfs/JSON")
    (v6.8 Perf)

With all of those applied everything is fixed even on Apple M. I don't 
think anything needs to be fixed for the bare "-e cycles" that you 
mentioned at the beginning of the chain because that never regressed, it 
actually never worked on big.LITTLE until 5c81672865, and after that 
using legacy was fine. I don't think Mark actually wants bare "cycles" 
to _not_ use legacy either because it never did. He only mentioned what 
happens when you really do want to target a PMU with a name (already 
fixed in a24d9d9dc).

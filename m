sched: Improve documentation for wake_up_bit/wait_on_bit family of functions

This patch revises the documention for wake_up_bit(),
clear_and_wake_up_bit(), and all the wait_on_bit() family of functions.

The new documentation places less emphasis on the pool of waitqueues
used (an implementation detail) and focuses instead on details of how
the functions behave.

The barriers included in the wait functions and clear_and_wake_up_bit()
and those required for wake_up_bit() are spelled out more clearly.

The error statuses returned are given explicitly.

The fact that the wait_on_bit_lock() function sets the bit is made more
obvious.

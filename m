-Qualcomm External Bus Interface 2 (EBI2)
-
-The EBI2 contains two peripheral blocks: XMEM and LCDC. The XMEM handles any
-external memory (such as NAND or other memory-mapped peripherals) whereas
-LCDC handles LCD displays.
-
-As it says it connects devices to an external bus interface, meaning address
-lines (up to 9 address lines so can only address 1KiB external memory space),
-data lines (16 bits), OE (output enable), ADV (address valid, used on some
-NOR flash memories), WE (write enable). This on top of 6 different chip selects
-(CS0 thru CS5) so that in theory 6 different devices can be connected.
-
-Apparently this bus is clocked at 64MHz. It has dedicated pins on the package
-and the bus can only come out on these pins, however if some of the pins are
-unused they can be left unconnected or remuxed to be used as GPIO or in some
-cases other orthogonal functions as well.
-
-Also CS1 and CS2 has -A and -B signals. Why they have that is unclear to me.
-
-The chip selects have the following memory range assignments. This region of
-memory is referred to as "Chip Peripheral SS FPB0" and is 168MB big.
-
-Chip Select                     Physical address base
-CS0 GPIO134                     0x1a800000-0x1b000000 (8MB)

-CS5 GPIO131                     0x1c000000-0x1c800000 (8MB)
-
-The APQ8060 Qualcomm Application Processor User Guide, 80-N7150-14 Rev. A,
-August 6, 2012 contains some incomplete documentation of the EBI2.
-
-FIXME: the manual mentions "write precharge cycles" and "precharge cycles".
-We have not been able to figure out which bit fields these correspond to
-in the hardware, or what valid values exist. The current hypothesis is that
-this is something just used on the FAST chip selects and that the SLOW
-chip selects are understood fully. There is also a "byte device enable"
-flag somewhere for 8bit memories.
-
-FIXME: The chipselects have SLOW and FAST configuration registers. It's a bit
-unclear what this means, if they are mutually exclusive or can be used
-together, or if some chip selects are hardwired to be FAST and others are SLOW
-by design.
-
-The XMEM registers are totally undocumented but could be partially decoded
-because the Cypress AN49576 Antioch Westbridge apparently has suspiciously
-similar register layout, see: http://www.cypress.com/file/105771/download
-
-Required properties:
-- compatible: should be one of:
-  "qcom,msm8660-ebi2"
-  "qcom,apq8060-ebi2"
-- #address-cells: should be <2>: the first cell is the chipselect,
-  the second cell is the offset inside the memory range
-- #size-cells: should be <1>
-- ranges: should be set to:
-  ranges = <0 0x0 0x1a800000 0x00800000>,
-           <1 0x0 0x1b000000 0x00800000>,

-           <4 0x0 0x1c800000 0x00800000>,
-           <5 0x0 0x1c000000 0x00800000>;
-- reg: two ranges of registers: EBI2 config and XMEM config areas
-- reg-names: should be "ebi2", "xmem"
-- clocks: two clocks, EBI_2X and EBI
-- clock-names: should be "ebi2x", "ebi2"
-
-Optional subnodes:
-- Nodes inside the EBI2 will be considered device nodes.
-
-The following optional properties are properties that can be tagged onto
-any device subnode. We are assuming that there can be only ONE device per
-chipselect subnode, else the properties will become ambiguous.
-
-Optional properties arrays for SLOW chip selects:
-- qcom,xmem-recovery-cycles: recovery cycles is the time the memory continues to
-  drive the data bus after OE is de-asserted, in order to avoid contention on
-  the data bus. They are inserted when reading one CS and switching to another
-  CS or read followed by write on the same CS. Valid values 0 thru 15. Minimum
-  value is actually 1, so a value of 0 will still yield 1 recovery cycle.
-- qcom,xmem-write-hold-cycles: write hold cycles, these are extra cycles
-  inserted after every write minimum 1. The data out is driven from the time
-  WE is asserted until CS is asserted. With a hold of 1 (value = 0), the CS
-  stays active for 1 extra cycle etc. Valid values 0 thru 15.
-- qcom,xmem-write-delta-cycles: initial latency for write cycles inserted for
-  the first write to a page or burst memory. Valid values 0 thru 255.
-- qcom,xmem-read-delta-cycles: initial latency for read cycles inserted for the
-  first read to a page or burst memory. Valid values 0 thru 255.
-- qcom,xmem-write-wait-cycles: number of wait cycles for every write access, 0=1
-  cycle. Valid values 0 thru 15.
-- qcom,xmem-read-wait-cycles: number of wait cycles for every read access, 0=1
-  cycle. Valid values 0 thru 15.
-
-Optional properties arrays for FAST chip selects:
-- qcom,xmem-address-hold-enable: this is a boolean property stating that we
-  shall hold the address for an extra cycle to meet hold time requirements
-  with ADV assertion.
-- qcom,xmem-adv-to-oe-recovery-cycles: the number of cycles elapsed before an OE
-  assertion, with respect to the cycle where ADV (address valid) is asserted.
-  2 means 2 cycles between ADV and OE. Valid values 0, 1, 2 or 3.
-- qcom,xmem-read-hold-cycles: the length in cycles of the first segment of a
-  read transfer. For a single read transfer this will be the time from CS
-  assertion to OE assertion. Valid values 0 thru 15.
-
-
-Example:
-
-ebi2@1a100000 {
-	compatible = "qcom,apq8060-ebi2";
-	#address-cells = <2>;

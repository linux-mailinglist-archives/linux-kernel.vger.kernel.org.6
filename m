Good morning Linus, I hope the week is going well for you.

Some reflections, for the record, on this issue.

I see that Paul Moore has further responded with commentary about the
'LSM community' responding to this issue.  I wanted, on behalf of our
project and in support of Tetsuo's concerns, to register directly with
you a sense of jaded skepticism about the notion of a community
response.

Fixing Tetsuo's issue, at least to the extent it can be fixed,
requires technical improvements in the Linux security architecture.
Currently, potential technical improvements in this venue are
struggling to receive any kind of acknowledgement or review, to the
ultimate detriment of enhancements that Linux should be bringing
forward to address, not only this issue, but the security industry
writ-large.

We have made multiple submissions of technology, that can at least
positively impact Tetsuo's concerns, and in the process perhaps
improve the opportunity for security innovation in Linux.  After 20
months of doing so we have yet to receive anything that would resemble
substantive technical review [1].

The following are links to the four submissions.  We believe an
unbiased observer would conclude that they provide ample evidence of
very little interest in reviewing submissions for enhancements to the
Linux security eco-system, outside of perhaps certain constituencies:

V1:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20230204050954.11583-1-greg@enjellic.com/T/#t

V2:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20230710102319.19716-1-greg@enjellic.com/T/#t

V3:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20240401105015.27614-1-greg@enjellic.com/T/#t

V4:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/20240826103728.3378-1-greg@enjellic.com/T/#t

As of the V4 release, we have added support for an approach that may
positively impact Tetsuo's concerns.  We do that without touching any
infrastructure outside of our proposed LSM.

We can speak, at great length, as to why we feel that Linux would
benefit from structural improvements to its security infrastructure.
We will refrain from doing so in this thread, given your stated
sentiments on these types of discussions.

However, your mantra, recently expressed on security infrastucture
issues, has always been:

"Code talks, bullshit walks."

For all of this to work, and the Linux community to remain healthy,
the code needs to be listened to and that is not effectively happening
in the security arena.

I started my involvement with Linux in late 1991.  All of what I see
is giving me a great deal of pause about the health of our community
moving forward and the potential negative impact these issues have on
the opportunity for security innovation to emerge

Have a good remainder of the week.

Apologies in advance for extending conversations you find tiresome.

As always,

[1]: A thank you to Casey Schaufler, despite our lively disagreement
about some issues, who has offered specific review comments and
dialogue about security modeling.  To Greg Kroah Hartman for
recommending the most important change we have implemented with
respect to JSON encoding of security events and a handful of other
individuals who have provided helpful procedural and technical point
suggestions.

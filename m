I don't have any magic to solve this. My thoughts:

1) I thought legacy events were just going to hang around forever,
although the name hinting they'd kind of been deprecated. At LPC '23
Atish and Mark Rutland originally asked for the sysfs/json to be the
preference. I thought Kan was going to push back given the upheaval,
especially updating every test expectation. It went through but we're
in this weird state where wildcard events are encoded using legacy and
PMU specifying events aren't. What this series hopes to solve.

2) I think it is important that perf tool be a reference
implementation where others can look (strace, etc.) to base their
implementation. Moving perf to sysfs/json is 1 step closer to legacy
event deprecation. Please yell if deprecation isn't what is wanted as
personally other than cleanliness I don't mind. If we do decide not to
have sysfs/json be the priority then I think it sensible to revert the
changes making it the priority for events that specify a PMU. I'd like
some level of consistency.

3) I'd like event parsing to be a library that is as easy to link
against as libbpf (i.e. not a viral license). Event parsing is really
just mapping an event name to 1 or more perf_event_attr. The PMU
abstraction is tied into the event parsing, but this has only been
more true recently. The evsel/evlist is tied into event parsing but
that feels separable. As most json isn't distributed under a viral
license this feels achievable, then I suspect most tools can use this
library rather than have to reinvent a wheel.

Still looking for tags :-)

Thanks,
Ian

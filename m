I do plan on updating the scheduler comments soon, so that every function
has a purpose. But there's a lot of history to the scheduler code that you
really can't just go and rename items. It causes a lot of churn which also
causes noise in the git history, where git blame is used a lot to find why
things were done. Adding renames causes one more level of indirection that
makes it harder on the maintainers to do git forensics.

I personally am not against these updates. But as I mentioned, there's a
lot of history here and it's really Peter Zijlstra's call (and he's been
against changes like this in the past).

So please do not be discourage if this doesn't get much traction.

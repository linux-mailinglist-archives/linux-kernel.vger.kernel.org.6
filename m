I would.

So my opinion is that these aren't good arguments.  We should be
identifying as Darwin by default in EFI, just as we've been doing
in ACPI since 7bc5a2bad0b8.  If there are any adverse effects,
we should look into them, but users shouldn't be forced to set
an obscure kernel parameter only to enable certain features of
their hardware.  It is for this reason that you'll usually get
Greg KH's trademark "this isn't the 90s anymore" comment when
adding new kernel parameters.  We need to handle the hardware
correctly *automatically*.

There is one known issue affecting the keyboard on certain
MacBook Air models:  Apple had been using dual SPI and USB
keyboards and trackpads since about 2013 but started to ship
SPI-only models in 2015 with the MacBook 12".

The models that shipped in the 2013/2014 time frame used USB
by default and were automatically switched to SPI if apple_set_os
is invoked.  Not a problem since drivers/input/keyboard/applespi.c
has been in mainline for a while now, but there are some very
specific models that lack certain data in the DSDT which the
applespi.c driver needs:

https://github.com/cb22/macbook12-spi-driver/issues/65

However at this point that shouldn't stop us from making
apple_set_os the default.  We should rather just try to amend
the applespi.c driver with a DMI quirk or something.
That requires someone to test patches, so we need to find
someone with an affected machine before we can fix it.

But potential issues with 10+ years old hardware shouldn't
stop us from enabling a feature by default that's useful on
more recent hardware.  So I'm strongly in favor of getting rid
of the kernel parameter and then let's work on addressing side
effects of apple_set_os one by one.

Just add __packed at the end of the declaration.
See efi_manage_capsule_header in include/linux/efi.h for an example.

I think we haven't been very consistent with __packed declarations.
The rationale not to use them everywhere is probably that gcc generally
doesn't insert padding if only 32-bit and 64-bit types are used,
but that's not guaranteed to be true forever.

I don't quite follow.  Andreas' grub patch doesn't have this
"mixed_mode" struct, so where is it (and the name) coming from?

Thanks,

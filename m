Hi Miguel

Disregarding the specific discussion here, but this just felt like a good
place to thank you for your work to bring rust to linux. Your calm and
understanding approach to figure out what fits best in each case, from "go
away, don't bother me with rust" through "I like this, but I have no clue"
all the way to "uh so we have four drivers now in progress, this is
getting messy" has and continues to enormously help in making this all a
success.

Thank you!

Obviously not diminishing everyone else's work here, just that Miguel's
effort on the culture and people impact of r4l stands out to me.

Cheers, Sima

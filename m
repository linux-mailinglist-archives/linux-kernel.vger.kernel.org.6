If we=E2=80=99re looking for a capability based control, could we tie that =
up to
FEAT_MTE_PERM? That=E2=80=99s what I did here:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250110110023.2963795-1-aneesh.kumar@kernel.org

That patch set also addresses the issue mentioned here. Let me know if
you think this is a better approach

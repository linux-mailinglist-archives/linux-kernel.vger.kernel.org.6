Yes, I saw that. It's a broken diff that won't even compile, with no 
explanation of what it's supposed to be trying to achieve or why. I'm 
not sure what you're asking me to comment on.

No, it's fine to claim the exact *same* range that the ACPI companion 
owns; the identical requests just nest inside each other. I don't have a 
CMN-700 to hand but here's a selection of other drivers doing just that 
from /proc/iomem on my system:

12600000-12600fff : ARMH0011:00
   12600000-12600fff : ARMH0011:00 ARMH0011:00
12610000-12610fff : ARMH0011:01
   12610000-12610fff : ARMH0011:01 ARMH0011:01
126b0000-126b0fff : APMC0D0F:00
   126b0000-126b0fff : APMC0D0F:00 APMC0D0F:00
126f0000-126f0fff : APMC0D81:00
   126f0000-126f0fff : APMC0D81:00 APMC0D81:00

And I know people are using the CMN-700 PMU on other ACPI systems 
without issue, so there's nothing wrong with the binding or the driver 
in general.

The resource conflict only arises when a request overlaps an existing 
region inexactly. Either your firmware is describing the CMN 
incorrectly, or some other driver is claiming conflicting iomem regions 
for some reason.

Thanks,
Robin.

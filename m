I am pretty sure the work on long term solution would be iterative which
will involve many reverts and redoing things differently. So, I think it
is understandable that we may need to revert or revert the reverts.

As I said I don't expect "safe in prod" as a strict requirement for a
change.

So, the (old_file >> sc->priority) > 0 is true but the (new_file >>

iteration, somehow kernel has reclaimed more than double what it was
supposed to reclaim or there are concurrent reclaimers. In addition the
nr_reclaim is still less than nr_to_reclaim and there is no file
deactivation request.

Yeah it can happen but a lot of wierd conditions need to happen
concurrently for this to happen.

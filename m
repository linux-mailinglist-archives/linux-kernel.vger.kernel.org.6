Regarding this version, I don't think I should add these.

I send this patch on July 9th, 2024.

The following email was sent on July 13th, 2024.

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-integrity/3b1755a9-b12f-42fc-b26d-de2fe4e13ec2@stanley.mountain/T/#u

I think these should be included in the subsequent versions (if any).

OK,got it,I'll pay more attention to such details in the future.

I would like to clarify that I did not taking credit and dishonest.

As stated earlier, the timeline indicates that my patch preceded his email.

Before submitting my patch, I conducted a thorough search to ensure that 
there were no related submissions,

 Â in order to avoid any duplication of effort and wastage of everyone's 
time.

I didn't expect to have wasted everyone's time because of commit message 
, and I sincerely apologize for that.


Thanks

BR

Hao

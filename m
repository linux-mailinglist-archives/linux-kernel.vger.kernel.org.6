Yup. I had that in mind. Forgot to actually add a link.

Agreed, but I think we are far away from a point where we can implement that.

Just working out how to tune the hardware to grab useful data is going
to take a while to figure out, let alone doing anything much with it.

Without care you won't get a meaningful signal for what is actually
hot out of the box. Lots of reasons why including:
a) Exhaustion of tracking resources, due to looking at too large a window
   or for too long.  Will probably need some form of auto updating of
   what is being scanning (coarse to fine might work though I'm doubtful,
   scanning across small regions maybe).
b) Threshold too high, no detections.
c) Threshold too low, everything hot.
d) Wrong timescales. Hot is not a well defined thing.
e) Hardware that won't do tracking at fine enough granularity.

Agreed that ultimately we'll end up somewhere like that.
These units are just a small part of what is needed in total.

That's certainly the intent. It's not going upstream in this form so
I haven't actually checked yet :)  Uses similar infrastructure to ARM
SPE which can also give physical address info + a lot more than that.

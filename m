Honestly, based on this long discussion, I really don't think we can
take any contribution from you without having someone else verify that
the the name you use here is correct.  Please work with the kernel.org
ring-of-trust to get a valid signature added to it and then I'll be glad
to reconsider.

And note, I'm not singling you out at all, we have recently had to do
this for many new contributors.

thanks,

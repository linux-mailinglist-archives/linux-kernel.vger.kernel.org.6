No, this is what I was referring to.  Also maybe we should be asking on
the drm list?  The developers there were working to get rid of CONFIG_VT
so I know they have plans for what they see replacing it.

Yes, it will be "after" the boot console, but that should be it.  It
shouldn't be stealing any keys away from anything, but rather going
through the existing apis we have for input devices and the like.

I don't know why distros seem to not be using it anymore, maybe there's
something else?

I share your frustrations, code gets complex over time, that is why I at
least try to ask these questions, encourage more granular patches, that
do just one thing, etc, to avoid having this conversation again years
from now, when some other person tries to understand the codebase do
bisects, refactor it, etc, just like you're doing now.

As I said, I think your patch is safe as-is, its just that it took more
time than needed for reviewing, i.e. it will cost more one side or the
other, and as I have to review everything I merge, doing it on my side
slows things down the overall process of collecting patches from lots of
people.

So far I collected 234 patches for v6.12, and there are way more to
process, like Howard's perf trace BTF work, that I merged partially,
but where I'll have to do work on splitting patches as agreed with him
in another thread, etc.

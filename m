This is correct, and I am well aware of it. I brought this up once when working
on the initial device / driver, devres and I/O abstractions.

It's on my list to make the creation of the Devres container fallible in this
aspect, which would prevent this issue.

For now it's probably not too critical; we never hand out device references
before probe(). The only source of error is when a driver tries to create new
device resources after the device has been unbound.

Devres callbacks run after remove(). It's the drivers job to stop operating the
device latest in remove(). Which means that the design is correct.

Now, you ask for a step further, i.e. make it that we can enforce that a driver
actually stopped the device in remove().

But that's just impossible, because obviously no one else than the driver knows
the semantics of the devicei; it's the whole purpose of the driver. So, this is
one of the exceptions where just have to trust the driver doing the correct
thing.

Having that said, it doesn't need to be an "all or nothing", let's catch the
ones we can actually catch.

Are you saying that the PTE dirty bit controls whether the CPU flushes
cache back to memory?  That isn't how I understand CPUs to work.

Dave and I talked about that case.  We were concerned not that _this_
manipulation would lead to a shadow stack entry appearing (since the
present bit is being cleared), but that the next manipulation would just
set the present bit without setting the RW bit and we'd accidentally
end up with one.

I don't understand why the dirty bit needs to be saved.  At least in
the vfree() case, we're freeing the memory so any unflushed writes to
it may as well disappear.  But I don't know all the circumstances in
which these functions are called.

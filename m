It seems to me that doing this ties it to the binary, rather than
execution context, which may want to seal/not-seal, etc. I have a sense
that it's be better as a secure bit, or prctl, or something like that. The
properties seem to be better suited for "this binary _can_ do a thing"
or "this binary _requires_ a thing", like the GNU_STACK bits, etc. But
maybe there's more to this I'm not considering?

I agree 100%, but I think we need to make small steps. Behind a CONFIG
means we get it implemented, and then we can look at how to make it more
flexible. I'm motivated to figure this out because I've long wanted to
have a boot param to disable CRIU since I have distro systems that I
don't use CRIU on, and I don't want the (very small) interface changes
it makes available into seccomp filter visibility. And if CRIU could be
run-time based, so could system mapping sealing. :)

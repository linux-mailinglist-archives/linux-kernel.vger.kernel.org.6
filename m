The objective of this series is to reduce memory usage, while trying to keep the performance benefits you get of using THP=always. Punishing any applications performance is the opposite of what I am trying to do here.
For e.g. if there is only one main application running in production, and its using majority of the THPs, then reducing its performance doesn't make sense.

Also, just going through the commit, and found the line "The advantage of shattering is that it keeps the original THP intact" a bit confusing. I am guessing the THP is freed? i.e. if a 2M THP has 10 non-zero filled base pages and the rest are zero-filled, then after shattering we will have 10*4K memory and not 2M+10*4K? Is it the case the THP is reused at next fault?

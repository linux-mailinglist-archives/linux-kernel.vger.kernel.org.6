Well, in concept it is incremented for every entry from user space, but
in reality it should only be incremented the first time it is
referenced when coming into user space. That is, if there's nothing
asking for a stack trace, then nothing should be incremented.

Actually, I don't think they should care. A stack trace should just be
passed to the callback. How that stack trace is created, is up to the
unwinder. sframe should be used if it's avaliable, otherwise it will
use the frame pointer. If neither is available, the callback could be
called with NULL for the stack trace and then it can figure out what to
do via pt_regs.

We could set a max when the tracer registers a callback. It can be -1
to mean "no limit".

I was talking with Mathieu at lunch, and we talked about having the
stack information pointer be part of the task_struct.

That is, the first time the unwinder is triggered and its doing the
unwind (either sfarme or fp), it will allocate memory to store the
stack trace information. This information is what is sent to the
tracer's callbacks. Again, the tracers do not care how the stack frame
was created. This memory is then saved in the task struct (freed when
the task exits), and reused for future stack traces.

If a stack trace could not be created, the callback just gets NULL and
that will tell the tracer that nothing is available for the user space
stack trace, and it can try to do something else. But that's not some
the unwinder should care about.

Not sure what that means, but from NMI, I would see the tracer doing:


	u64 cookie;

	cookie = undwinder_trigger();


And then the tracer is responsible to do something with that cookie.
This would also trigger the "task_work()"  where the ptrace path is
entered when going back to user space, the unwinder will try to create a
stack trace (from sframe or fp), saving it in this allocated memory
that is then stored via a pointer on the task_struct so it only needs
to be allocated once (or if a stack trace is bigger than what was
allocated).

Then all the tracer callbacks will be called with the stack trace and
the cookie. The tracer will decided if it should use the stack trace
from the cookie, or just ignore it. But the tracer shouldn't care about
sframes or frame pointers. That's an implementation detail of the
unwinder.

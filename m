Generally the kernel/host OS and the firmware are touching different
PCRs in the TPM.

The firmware eventlog covers what the firmware/bootloader measured;
itself, option ROMs, secure boot details, bootloader, initial
kernel/initrd (if we're talking grub as the initial bootloader). These
details are not changed by a kexec, and provide the anchor of the
software trust chain.

A kexec'd kernel will generally not touch the same PCRs. The primary way
I know to carry kexec measurements / logs over to new kernels is using
IMA, which will be configured to use one of the later PCRs (default of
10).

That means that the firmware event log is still completely valid to
subsequent kernels, and is still required to validate the
firmware/bootloader trust chain. You then probably _also_ want to make
use of the IMA log to validate the kexec'd kernel chain, but that's
separate.

There's a real requirement and use for kexec'd kernels to be able to
continue to access the firmware TPM event log; to the extent that there
are also patches floating around to have this carried over via device
tree on non-UEFI platforms.

Looks like some places there use VM_WARN_ON_IRQS_ENABLED() that's turned off
for PREEMPT_RT, so maybe that's what should replace the current
lockdep_assert, perhaps together with
lockdep_assert_held(this_cpu_ptr(&memcg_stock.stock_lock));

But also __mod_memcg_lruvec_state() already has that VM_WARN_ON.

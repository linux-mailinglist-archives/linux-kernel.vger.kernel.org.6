So, I just give your patch a test, and result is 1.3s while 1s is
expected. While debuging, a new idea come up in mind. :)

How about keep at least one slice out of consideration from
throtl_trim_slice()? With following patch, the result is between
1.01-1.03s in my VM.

Yes, this case is just a theory, we don't need to care for now. :)

+ fsck.ubifs
+ ==========
+ The fsck.ubifs can check and repair the UBIFS image on a given UBI volume, it
+ could fix inconsistent UBIFS image(which is corrupted by hardware exceptions
+ or UBIFS realization bugs) and makes filesystem become consistent.
+
+
+ Manuals
+ -------
+ There are four modes for fsck.ubifs:
+ 1. normal mode(no options): Check the filesystem, ask user whether to fix the
+    problem as long as inconsistent data is found during fs checking.
+ 2. safe mode(-a option): Check and automatic safely repair the filesystem, if
+    there are any data dropping operations needed by fixing, fsck will fail.
+ 3. danger mode(-y option): Answer 'yes' to all questions. There are two sub
+    modes:
+    a) Default submode(no options): Check and automatic repair the filesystem
+       according to TNC, data dropping will be reported. If TNC/master/log is
+       corrupted, fsck will fail.
+    b) rebuild submode(-b option): Check and automatic forcibly repair the
+       filesystem, turns to rebuild filesystem if TNC/master/log is corrupted.
+       Always make fsck successful.
+ 4. check mode(-n option): Make no changes to the filesystem, only check the
+    filesystem. This mode doesn't check space, because unclean LEBs cannot be
+    rewritten in read-only mode.
+
+ The exit code returned by fsck.ubifs is compatible with FSCK(8), which is the
+ sum of the following conditions:
+ 0	- No errors
+ 1	- File system errors corrected
+ 2	- System should be rebooted
+ 4	- File system errors left uncorrected
+ 8	- Operational error
+ 16	- Usage or syntax error
+ 32	- Fsck canceled by user request
+ 128	- Shared library error
+
+
+ Designment
+ ----------
+ There are 2 working modes for fsck: rebuild mode and non-rebuild mode. The main
+ idea is that construct all files by scanning the entire filesystem, then check
+ the consistency of metadata(file meta information, space statistics, etc.)
+ according to the files. The file(xattr is treated as a file) is organized as:
+   file tree(rbtree, inum indexed)
+            /      \
+         file1   file2
+         /   \
+      file3 file4
+ file {
+     inode node // each file has 1 inode node
+     dentry (sub rb_tree, sqnum indexed)
+     // '/' has no dentries, otherwise at least 1 dentry is required.
+     trun node // the newest one truncation node
+     data (sub rb_tree, block number indexed)
+     // Each file may have 0 or many data nodes
+     xattrs (sub rb_tree, inum indexed)
+     // Each file may have 0 or many xattr files
+ }
+
+ Step 0. Both two modes need to read the superblock firstly, fsck fails if
+         superblock is corrupted, because fsck has no idea about the location
+         of each area(master, log, main, etc.) when the layout is lost.
+
+ A. Rebuild mode:
+ Step 1. Scan nodes(inode node/dentry node/data node/truncation node) from all
+         LEBs.
+         a) Corrupted LEBs(eg. garbage data, corrupted empty space) are dropped
+            during scanning.
+         b) Corrupted nodes(eg. incorrect crc, bad inode size, bad dentry name
+            length, etc.) are dropped during scanning.
+         c) Valid inode nodes(nlink > 0) and dentry nodes(inum != 0) are put
+            into two valid trees(valid_inos & valid_dents) separately.
+         d) Deleted inode nodes (nlink is 0) and deleted dentry nodes(inum is 0)
+            are put into two deleted trees(del_inos & del_dents) separately.
+         e) Other nodes(data nodes/truncation node) are put into corresponding
+            file, if the file doesn't exist, insert a new file into the file
+            tree.
+ Step 2. Traverse nodes from deleted trees, remove inode nodes and dentry nodes
+         with smaller sqnum from valid trees. valid_inos - del_inos = left_inos,
+         valid_dents - del_dents = left_dents.
+         This step handles the deleting case, for example, file A is deleted,
+         deleted inode node and deleted dentry node are written, if we ignore
+         the deleted nodes, file A can be recovered after rebuilding because
+         undeleted inode node and undeleted dentry node can be scanned. There's
+         an exception, if deleted inode node and deleted dentry node are
+         reclaimed(by gc) after deletion, file A is recovered. So deleted data
+         or files could be recovered by rebuild mode.
+ Step 3. Traverse left_inos and left_dents, insert inode node and dentry nodes
+         into the corresponding file.
+ Step 4. Traverse all files, drop invalid files, move xattr files into the
+         corresponding host file's subtree. Invalid files such as:
+         a) File has no inode node or inode nlink is zero
+         b) Non-consistent file types between inode node and dentry nodes
+         c) File has no dentry nodes(excepts '/')
+         d) Encrypted file has no xattr information
+         e) Non regular file has data nodes
+         f) Directory/xattr file has more than one dentries
+         g) Xattr file has no host inode, or the host inode is a xattr
+         h) Non-xattr file's parent is not a directory
+         i) etc.
+ Step 5. Extract reachable directory entries tree. Make sure that all files can
+         be searched from '/', unreachable file is deleted. Since all xattr
+         files are attached to the corresponding host file, only non-xattr
+         files should be checked. Luckily, directory file only has one dentry,
+         the reachable checking of a dentry becomes easy. Traverse all
+         dentries for each file, check whether the dentry is reachable, if not,
+         remove dentry from the file. If the file has no dentries, the file is
+         unreachable.
+ Step 6. Correct the file information. Traverse all files and calculate
+         information(nlink, size, xattr_cnt, etc.) for each file just like
+         check_leaf(in linux kernel) does, correct the inode node based on the
+         calculated information.
+ Step 7. Record used LEBs. Traverse all files'(including effective nodes from
+         deletion trees in step 2) position, after this step fsck knows which
+         LEB is empty.
+ Step 8. Re-write data. Read data from LEB and write back data, make sure that
+         all LEB is ended with empty data(0xFF). It will prevent failed gc
+         scanning in the next mounting.
+ Step 9. Build TNC. Construct TNC according to all files' nodes, just like mkfs
+         does(refer to add_to_index in mkfs), then write TNC(refer to
+         write_index in mkfs) on flash. (If there are no files, create a new
+         root dir file.)
+ Step 10.Build LPT. Construct LPT according to all nodes' position and length,
+         just like mkfs does, then write LPT(refer to write_lpt) on flash.
+ Step 11.Clean up log area and orphan area. Log area and orphan area can be
+         erased.
+ Step 12.Write master node. Since all meta areas are ready, master node can be
+         updated.
+
+ B. Non-rebuild mode:
+ Step 1. Read master & init lpt.
+         a) Scan master nodes failed or master node is invalid (which is not
+            caused by invalid space statistics), danger mode with rebuild_fs and
+            normal mode with 'yes' answer will turn to rebuild mode, other modes
+            will exit. Fsck cannot find the right TNC/LPT if the master node is
+            invalid, which affects subsequent steps, so this problem must be
+            fixed.
+         b) Invalid space statistics in master node, set %FR_LPT_INCORRECT for
+            for lpt status and ignore the error.
+         c) LPT node is corrupted, set %FR_LPT_CORRUPTED for lpt status and
+            ignore the error.
+ Step 2. Replay journal.
+         I. Scan log LEBs to get all buds.
+            a) Nodes in log LEBs are invalid/corrupted, danger mode with
+               rebuild_fs and normal mode with 'yes' answer will turn to rebuild
+               mode, other modes will exit. Corrupted log LEB could fail
+               ubifs_consolidate_log, which may lead to commit failure by out of
+	       space in the log area, so this problem must be fixed.
+         II. Scan bud LEBs to get all nodes.
+             a) Nodes in bud LEBs are invalid/corrupted, danger mode and normal
+                mode with 'yes' answer will drop bud LEB and set
+                %FR_LPT_INCORRECT for lpt status, other modes will exit.
+                Corrupted LEB will make gc failed, so this problem must be
+                fixed.
+	 III. Record isize into size tree according to data/truncation/inode
+              nodes.
+         IV. Apply nodes to TNC & LPT, update property for bud LEBs.
+             a) Corrupted/Invalid node searched from TNC, skip node and set
+                %FR_LPT_INCORRECT in lpt status for danger mode and normal mode
+                with 'yes' answer, other modes will exit. The space statistics
+                depend on a valid TNC, so this problem must be fixed.
+             b) Corrupted/Invalid index node read from TNC, danger mode with
+                rebuild_fs and normal mode with 'yes' answer will turn to
+                rebuild filesystem, other modes will exit. The space statistics
+                depend on a valid TNC, so this problem must be fixed.
+             c) Corrupted/Invalid lpt node, Set %FR_LPT_CORRUPTED for lpt status
+                and ignore the error.
+             d) Incorrect LEB property: Set %FR_LPT_INCORRECT for lpt status and
+                ignore the error.
+             e) If lpt status is not empty, skip updating lpt, because incorrect
+                LEB property could trigger assertion failure in ubifs_change_lp.
+ Step 3. Handle orphan nodes.
+         I. Scan orphan LEB to get all orphan nodes.
+            a) Corrupted/Invalid orphan node: danger mode and normal mode with
+               'yes' answer will drop orphan LEB, other modes will exit.
+               Corrupted orphan area could lead to mounting/committing failure,
+               so this problem must be fixed.
+         II. Parse orphan node, find the original inode for each inum.
+             a) Corrupted/Invalid node searched from TNC, skip node for danger
+                mode and normal mode with 'yes' answer, other modes will exit.
+             b) Corrupted/Invalid index node read from TNC, danger mode with
+                rebuild_fs and normal mode with 'yes' answer will turn to
+                rebuild filesystem, other modes will exit. The space statistics
+                depend on a valid TNC, so this problem must be fixed.
+         III. Remove inode for each inum, update TNC & LPT.
+              a) Corrupted/Invalid node searched from TNC, skip node for danger
+                 mode and normal mode with 'yes' answer, other modes will exit.
+              b) Corrupted/Invalid index node read from TNC, danger mode with
+                 rebuild_fs and normal mode with 'yes' answer will turn to
+                 rebuild filesystem, other modes will exit. The space statistics
+                 depend on a valid TNC, so this problem must be fixed.
+              c) Corrupted/Invalid lpt node, Set %FR_LPT_CORRUPTED for lpt
+                 status and ignore the error.
+              d) Incorrect LEB property: Set %FR_LPT_INCORRECT for lpt status
+                 and ignore the error.
+              e) If lpt status is not empty, skip updating lpt, because
+                 incorrect LEB property could trigger assertion failure in
+                 ubifs_change_lp.
+ Step 4. Consolidate log area.
+         a) Corrupted data in log LEBs, danger mode with rebuild_fs and normal
+            mode with 'yes' answer will turn to rebuild filesystem, other modes
+            will exit. It could make commit failed by out of space in log area,
+            so this problem must be fixed.
+ Step 5. Recover isize.
+         I. Traverse size tree, lookup corresponding inode from TNC.
+            a) Corrupted/Invalid node searched from TNC, skip node for danger
+               mode and normal mode with 'yes' answer, other modes will exit.
+            b) Corrupted/Invalid index node read from TNC, danger mode with
+               rebuild_fs and normal mode with 'yes' answer will turn to
+               rebuild filesystem, other modes will exit. The space statistics
+               depend on a valid TNC, so this problem must be fixed.
+         II. Update isize for inode. Keep <inum, isize> in size tree for check
+             mode, remove <inum, isize> from the size tree and update inode
+             node in place for other modes.
+ Step 6. Traverse TNC and construct files.
+         I. Traverse TNC, check whether the leaf node is valid, remove invalid
+            nodes, construct file for valid node and insert the file into the
+            file tree.
+            a) Corrupted/Invalid node searched from TNC, remove corresponding
+               TNC branch for danger mode and normal mode with 'yes' answer,
+               other modes will exit. The space statistics depend on a valid
+               TNC, so this problem must be fixed.
+            b) Corrupted/Invalid index node read from TNC, danger mode with
+               rebuild_fs and normal mode with 'yes' answer will turn to
+               rebuild filesystem, other modes will exit. The space statistics
+               depend on a valid TNC, so this problem must be fixed.
+         II. Scan all LEBs(contain TNC) for non check mode(unclean LEBs cannot
+             be fixed in read-only mode, so scanning may fail in check mode,
+             then space statistics won't be checked in check mode), remove TNC
+             branch which points to corrupted LEB.
+             a) Corrupted data is found by scanning. If the current node is
+                index node, danger mode with rebuild_fs and normal mode with
+                'yes' answer will turn to rebuild filesystem, other modes will
+                exit; If the current node is non-index node, danger mode and
+                normal mode with 'yes' answer will remove all TNC branches which
+                point to the corrupted LEB, other modes will exit. The space
+                statistics depend on valid LEB scanning, so this problem must
+                be fixed.
+             b) LEB contains both index and non-index nodes, danger mode with
+                rebuild_fs and normal mode with 'yes' answer will turn to
+                rebuild filesystem, other modes will exit. Invalid LEB will make
+                gc failed, so this problem must be fixed.
+ Step 7. Update files' size for check mode. Update files' size according to the
+          size tree for check mode.
+ Step 8. Check and handle invalid files. Similar to rebuild mode, but the
+         methods of handling are different:
+         a) Move unattached(file has no dentries) regular file into disconnected
+            list for safe mode, danger mode and normal mode with 'yes' answer,
+            let subsequent steps to handle them with lost+found. Other modes
+            will exit. Disconnected file affects the result of calculated
+            information(which will be used in subsequent steps) for its' parent
+            file(eg. nlink, size), so this problem must be fixed.
+         b) Make file type be consistent between inode, detries and data nodes
+            by deleting dentries or data nodes, for danger mode and normal mode
+            with 'yes' answer, other modes will exit.
+         c) Delete file for other invalid cases(eg. file has no inode) in
+            danger mode and normal mode with 'yes' answer, other modes will
+            exit.
+ Step 9. Extract reachable directory entries tree. Similar to rebuild mode, but
+         the methods of handling are different:
+         a) Remove unreachable dentry for danger mode and normal mode with 'yes'
+            answer, other modes will exit. Unreachable dentry affects the
+            calculated information(which will be used in subsequent steps) for
+            its' file(eg. nlink), so this problem must be fixed.
+         b) Delete unreachable non-regular file for danger mode and normal mode
+            with 'yes' answer, other modes will exit. Unreachable file affects
+            the calculated information(which will be used in subsequent steps)
+            for its' parent file(eg. nlink, size), so this problem must be
+            fixed.
+         c) Move unreachable regular file into disconnected list for safe mode,
+            danger mode and normal mode with 'yes' answer, let subsequent steps
+            to handle them with lost+found. Other modes will exit. Disconnected
+            file affects the calculated information(which will be used in
+            subsequent steps) for its' parent file(eg. nlink, size), so this
+            problem must be fixed.
+ Step 10.Correct the file information. Similar to rebuild mode, but the methods
+         of handling are different:
+         a) Correct the file information for safe mode, danger mode and normal
+            mode with 'yes' answer, other modes will exit. Incorrect file
+            information affects the new creations(which will be used in handling
+            lost+found), so this problem must be fixed.
+ Step 11.Check whether the TNC is empty. Empty TNC is equal to corrupted TNC,
+         which means that zero child count for root znode. If TNC is empty(All
+         nodes are invalid and are deleted from TNC), turn to rebuild mode for
+         danger mode with rebuild_fs and normal mode with 'yes' answer, other
+         modes will exit.
+ Step 12.Check and correct the space statistics.
+         I. Exit for check mode, if %FR_LPT_CORRUPTED or %FR_LPT_INCORRECT is
+            set in lpt status, the exit code should have %FSCK_UNCORRECTED.
+         II. Check lpt status, if %FR_LPT_CORRUPTED is set in lpt status, normal
+             mode with 'no' answer will exit, other modes will rebuild lpt. New
+             creations could be done in subsequent steps, which depends on
+             correct space statistics, so this problem must be fixed.
+         III. Traverse LPT nodes, check the correctness of nnode and pnode,
+              compare LEB scanning result with LEB properties.
+              a) LPT node is corrupted, normal mode with 'no' answer will exit,
+                 rebuild lpt for other modes. New creations could be done in
+                 subsequent steps, which depends on the correct space
+                 statistics, so this problem must be fixed.
+              b) Incorrect nnode/pnode, normal mode with 'no' answer will exit,
+                 other other modes will correct the nnode/pnode. New creations
+                 could be done in subsequent steps, which depends on correct
+                 space statistics, so this problem must be fixed.
+              c) Inconsistent comparing result, normal mode with 'no' answer
+                 will exit, other modes will correct the space statistics. New
+                 creations could be done in subsequent steps, which depends on
+                 correct space statistics, so this problem must be fixed.
+         IV. Compare LPT area scanning result with lprops table information.
+             a) LPT area is corrupted, normal mode with 'no' answer will exit,
+                rebuild lpt for other modes. Commit could fail in doing LPT gc
+                caused by scanning corrupted data, so this problem must be
+                fixed.
+             b) Inconsistent comparing result, normal mode with 'no' answer
+                will exit, other modes will correct the lprops table
+                information. Commit could fail in writing LPT with %ENOSPC
+                return code caused by incorrect space statistics in the LPT
+                area, so this problem must be fixed.
+ Step 13.Do commit, commit problem fixing modifications to disk. The index size
+         checking depends on this step.
+ Step 14.Check and correct the index size. Check and correct the index size by
+         traversing TNC just like dbg_check_idx_size does. This step should be
+         executed after first committing, because 'c->calc_idx_sz' can be
+         changed in 'ubifs_tnc_start_commit' and the initial value of
+         'c->calc_idx_sz' read from the disk is untrusted. Correct the index
+         size for safe mode, danger mode and normal mode with 'yes' answer,
+         other modes will exit. New creations could be done in subsequent steps,
+         which depends on the correct index size, so this problem must be fixed.
+ Step 15.Check and create the root dir. Check whether the root dir exists,
+         create a new one if it is not found, for safe mode, danger mode and
+         normal mode with 'yes' answer, other modes will exit. Mounting depends
+         on the root dir, so this problem must be fixed.
+ Step 16.Check and create the lost+found.
+         I. If the root dir is encrypted, set lost+found as invalid. Because it
+            is impossible to check whether the lost+found exists in an encrypted
+            directory.
+         II. Search the lost+found under root dir.
+             a) Found a lost+found, lost+found is a non-encrypted directory, set
+                lost+found as valid, otherwise set lost+found as invalid.
+             b) Not found the lost+found, create a new one. If creation is
+                failed by %ENOSPC, set lost+found as invalid.
+ Step 17.Handle each file from the disconnected list.
+         I. If lost+found is invalid, delete file for danger mode and normal
+            mode with 'yes' answer, other modes will skip and set the exit code
+            with %FSCK_UNCORRECTED.
+        II. If lost+found is valid, link disconnected file under lost+found
+            directory with the name of the corresponding inode number
+            (INO_<inum>_<index>, index(starts from 0) is used to handle the
+             conflicted names).
+             a) Fails in handling conflicted file names, delete file for danger
+                mode and normal mode with 'yes' answer, other modes will skip
+                and set the exit code with %FSCK_UNCORRECTED.
+             b) Fails in linking caused by %ENOSPC, delete file for danger mode
+                and normal mode with 'yes' answer, other modes will skip and set
+                the exit code with %FSCK_UNCORRECTED.
+ Step 18.Do final commit, commit problem fixing modifications to disk and clear
+         %UBIFS_MST_DIRTY flag for master node.
+
+
+ Advantage
+ ---------
+ 1. Can be used for any UBIFS image, fsck has nothing to do with kernel version.
+ 2. Fsck is tolerant with power-cut, fsck will always succeed in a certain mode
+    without changing mode even power-cut happens in checking and repairing. In
+    other words, fsck won't let UBIFS image become worse in abnormal situations.
+ 3. It is compatible with FSCK(8), the exit code returned by fsck.ubifs is same
+    as FSCK, the command options used by fsck are supported in fsck.ubifs too.
+ 4. The UBIFS image can be fixed as long as the super block is not corrupted.
+ 5. Encrypted UBIFS image is supported, because dentry name and data content of
+    file are not necessary for fsck.
+
+
+ Limitations
+ -----------
+ 1. UBIFS image file is not supported(Not like ext4). The UBIFS image file is
+    not equal to UBI volume, empty LEBs are not included in image file, so UBIFS
+    cannot allocate empty space when file recovering is needed. Another reason
+    is that atomic LEB changing is not supported by image file.
+ 2. Authenticated UBIFS image is not supported, UBIFS metadata(TNC/LPT) parsing
+    depends on the authentication key which is not supported in fsck options.

The results I got look different:

SUT kernel arm64 (mysql-8.4.0)

(1) 6.5.13					    baseline	

(2) 6.12.0-rc4 					    -12.9%
	
(3) 6.12.0-rc4 NO_PLACE_LAG			     +6.4%		

(4) v6.12-rc4 SCHED_BATCH			    +10.8%

5 test runs each: confidence level (95%) <= ±0.56%

(2) is still in sync but (3)/(4) looks way better for me.

Maybe a difference in our test setup can explain the different test results:

I use:

HammerDB Load Generator <-> MySQL SUT
192 VCPUs               <-> 16 VCPUs

Virtual users: 256
Warehouse count: 64
3 min rampup
10 min test run time
performance data: NOPM (New Operations Per Minute)

So I have 256 'connection' tasks running on the 16 SUT VCPUS.

OK.

Yeah, I did. The results where worse than running all mysqld threads in
SCHED_BATCH but still better than the baseline.

(5) v6.12-rc4 'connection' tasks in SCHED_BATCH		+6.8%

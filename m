But those IPIs are of no help whatsoever when the target CPU is spinning
with interrupts disabled, which is the scenario under discussion.

Hence my suggestion that arm64, when using IRQs to request stack
backtraces, have an additional short timeout (milliseconds) in
order to fall back to remote stack tracing.  In many cases, this
fallback happens automatically, as you can see in dump_cpu_task().
If trigger_single_cpu_backtrace() returns false, the stack is dumped
remotely.

Because arm32 isn't used much for datacenter workloads, it will not
be suffering from this issue.  Not enough to have motivated anyone to
fix it, anyway.  In contrast, in the datacenter, CPUs really can and
do have interrupts disabled for many seconds.  (No, this is not a good
thing, but it is common enough for us to need to avoid disabling other
debugging facilities.)

So it might well be that arm32 will continue to do just fine with
IRQ-based stack tracing.  Or maybe someday arm32 will also need to deal
with this same issue.  But no "maybe" for arm64, given its increasing
use in the datacenter.

Let's please keep the 10-second timeout for NMI-based backtraces.

But I take it that you are not opposed to a shorter timeout for the
special case of IRQ-based stack backtrace requests?

A bit more of context and history.
We have a generic platform parsing code for parsing the firmware tables
(DT and ACPI) in CoreSight. This will parse most generic bits (read, the
graph connections) to avoid duplicating the code. Most of the components
have both in and out connections (except trace sources and other helper
devices like this TMC CU).

Also, the "previous" (now legacy) DT graph bindings for CoreSight relied
on using standard "ports" with a property to indicate whether a given
port is "input". The platform driver still supports this for any legacy
platform that hasn't moved over (of course with a complaint of using
obsolete bindings in the dmesg).

Now the above proposal is going to conflict with the legacy binding
handling, where "ports" indicate output ports by default, without
the obsolete property and the driver can't differentiate this from
a legacy binding vs modern binding with individual driver to decide
the direction of the port. Nothing unfixable, but I don't understand
what is wrong in calling "input ports" in-ports. But if that is
definitely a no go area, we would need to add "fixup" logic in 
individual drivers to "correct" the type of a port (i.e, all output 
ports in the parsed data to input ports) and live with it.

Kind regards

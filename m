Sorry, I didn't include linux-kernel, so my and Qais' reply that is missing
is quoted here in full. You can also find it here:

FWIW that patch was mostly to narrow down the problem Manish is experiencing, I
wasn't proposing it as a proper patch.

I would argue rq_affinity=1 matches the perf, so that flag should already bias
perf in favor of power slightly?
Although the actual effect on power probably isn't that significant, given
that the (e.g. big) CPU has submitted the IO, is woken up soon, so you could
almost ignore a potential idle wakeup and the actual CPU time spent in the block
completion is pretty short of course.

So first of all, per-task iowait boosting has nothing to do with it IMO.
Plenty of IO workloads build up utilization perfectly fine.
I wouldn't consider the setup: requester little perf, irq+completion big perf
invalid necessarily, it does decrease IO latency for the application.
Consider the IO being page faults (maybe even of various applications running
on little).

The simple_ondemand dependency sadly isn't visible as a symbol. It's
currently 'fixed' by using a softdep, but that has drawbacks and doesn't
actually express the requirement. A "weakdep" works, but has the
drawback that it implies that the dependency is optional. This patch at
least means that the driver can express the dependency, even if
currently that just gets output as the same weakdep.

I'm not sure what the logic was behind the name "weak" - what we
(currently at least) have in panfrost is not a weak dependency by the
normal definition of the term - the driver will fail to load if the
ondemand governor is unavailable.

This patch doesn't solve the confusion, but at least means panfrost
doesn't need another round of churn in the future. The alternative
presumably is don't merge this and panfrost will have to wait until a
proper "hard dependency" mechanism is available.

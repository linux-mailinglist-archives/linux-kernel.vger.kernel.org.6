Hi Terry,

Could you share a little more about the qemu test setup?
From what I see, it seems currently qemu can only inject error to
type3 devices, is that true? Or how to do that for port devices?
Do we need a hack there?

Also, is the aer-inject tool you mentioned the one currently in the kernel
or something else?

Thanks,
Fan

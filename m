My understanding is that we make small patches so that the codebase is
more bisectable. When there is something new, like a driver or here a
hwmon PMU, the first patch is large and then we switch to the small
patch model. I have seen patches adding constants ahead of them being
used, but not normally as enums. I've already reduced the size of the
patch by moving everything that isn't hwmon PMU out of the patch and
most of that has already landed. Moving enums out of a header file
okay, shouldn't break the build (a compiler may complain about unused
enums) but then I end up copying comments into commit messages and
doing something alien to what is done in the rest of the kernel. Not
defining a function when you declare it, that is in many cases a
compiler error and for good reason. Adding in changes that are what
are or could be compiler errors goes against making things bisectable.

So breaking up this patch is bad as:
1) it doesn't match existing kernel style,
2) it makes the patch harder to understand (declarations split from
definitions, etc.),
3) with new compiler errors/warnings the code will be less bisectable
as we're deliberately doing things we think wrong for the sake of a
lines-of-code size,
4) we increase the number of patches and commit messages, with commit
messages duplicating comments for things like functions or enums being
added,
5) with your patches we create an intermediate PMU with different
conventions than the rest of the code base and with bugs, impacting
bisectability and the ability to understand the code base.

So I'm arguing against doing this as it is contrary to both our normal
objectives and existing style. I have no real way of knowing when I've
cut something up small enough and if we're not building the code then
how do I build/test the intermediate states, I'm just out on a wild
goose chase.

Thanks,
Ian

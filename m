Hey Sudeep,

Thanks for taking time to review the series.

^^ is largely untrue, a lot of finger pointing and a gross
misrepresentation of reality :/

The only major problem that X1E perf protocol has is a firmware
crash in the LEVEL_GET regular message implementation. This
pretty much went unnoticed because of messaging in perf implementation
in kernel. Given the fastchannel implementation isn't mandatory
according to spec, the kernel clearly says it switches to
regular messaging when it clearly doesn't do that and uses
stale data structures instead. This ensured that level get regular
messaging never got tested.

We pretty much have been good upstream citizens, finding bugs and
sending fixes wherever we can. We clearly don't deserve such a hostile
stance.

Not fully compliant to the spec? I am pretty sure this series would
have been shot down completely and NAKd on the list by you if that
was the case lol.

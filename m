Update events from v28 to v29.
Update TMA metrics from 4.8 to 5.02.

Bring in the event updates v29:
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/71dbf03aba964f79fb096c9ded385c8a486=
a99b3

The TMA 5.02 update is from (with subsequent fixes):
https://github.com/intel/perfmon/commit/1d72913b2d938781fb28f3cc3507aaec5c2=

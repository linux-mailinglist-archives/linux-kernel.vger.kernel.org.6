From: "Borislav Petkov (AMD)" <bp@alien8.de>

Documentation/arch/x86/x86_64/boot-options.rst is causing unnecessary
confusion by being a second place where one can put x86 boot options.
Move them into the main one.

Drop removed ones like "acpi=ht", while at it.

-    to get slightly better performance in multiprocessor benchmarks. It also
-    makes some profiling using performance counters more accurate.
-    Please note that on systems with MONITOR/MWAIT support (like Intel EM64T
-    CPUs) this option has no performance advantage over the normal idle loop.
-    It may also interact badly with hyperthreading.

-Rebooting
-=========
-
-   reboot=b[ios] | t[riple] | k[bd] | a[cpi] | e[fi] | p[ci] [, [w]arm | [c]old]
-      bios
-        Use the CPU reboot vector for warm reset
-      warm
-        Don't set the cold reboot flag
-      cold
-        Set the cold reboot flag
-      triple
-        Force a triple fault (init)
-      kbd
-        Use the keyboard controller. cold reset (default)
-      acpi
-        Use the ACPI RESET_REG in the FADT. If ACPI is not configured or
-        the ACPI reset does not work, the reboot path attempts the reset
-        using the keyboard controller.
-      efi
-        Use efi reset_system runtime service. If EFI is not configured or
-        the EFI reset does not work, the reboot path attempts the reset using
-        the keyboard controller.
-      pci
-        Use a write to the PCI config space register 0xcf9 to trigger reboot.
-
-   Using warm reset will be much faster especially on big memory
-   systems because the BIOS will not go through the memory check.
-   Disadvantage is that not all hardware will be completely reinitialized
-   on reboot so there may be boot problems on some systems.
-
-   reboot=force
-     Don't stop other CPUs on reboot. This can make reboot more reliable
-     in some cases.
-
-   reboot=default
-     There are some built-in platform specific "quirks" - you may see:
-     "reboot: <name> series board detected. Selecting <type> for reboots."
-     In the case where you think the quirk is in error (e.g. you have
-     newer BIOS, or newer board) using this option will ignore the built-in
-     quirk table, and use the generic default reboot actions.
-
-NUMA
-====
-
-  numa=off
-    Only set up a single NUMA node spanning all memory.
-
-  numa=noacpi
-    Don't parse the SRAT table for NUMA setup
-
-  numa=nohmat
-    Don't parse the HMAT table for NUMA setup, or soft-reserved memory
-    partitioning.
-
-ACPI
-====
-
-  acpi=off
-    Don't enable ACPI
-  acpi=ht
-    Use ACPI boot table parsing, but don't enable ACPI interpreter
-  acpi=force
-    Force ACPI on (currently not needed)
-  acpi=strict
-    Disable out of spec ACPI workarounds.
-  acpi_sci={edge,level,high,low}
-    Set up ACPI SCI interrupt.
-  acpi=noirq
-    Don't route interrupts
-  acpi=nocmcff
-    Disable firmware first mode for corrected errors. This
-    disables parsing the HEST CMC error source to check if
-    firmware has set the FF flag. This may result in
-    duplicate corrected error reports.
-
-PCI
-===
-
-  pci=off
-    Don't use PCI
-  pci=conf1
-    Use conf1 access.
-  pci=conf2
-    Use conf2 access.
-  pci=rom
-    Assign ROMs.
-  pci=assign-busses
-    Assign busses
-  pci=irqmask=MASK
-    Set PCI interrupt mask to MASK
-  pci=lastbus=NUMBER
-    Scan up to NUMBER busses, no matter what the mptable says.
-  pci=noacpi
-    Don't use ACPI to set up PCI interrupt routing.
-
-IOMMU (input/output memory management unit)
-===========================================
-Multiple x86-64 PCI-DMA mapping implementations exist, for example:
-
-   1. <kernel/dma/direct.c>: use no hardware/software IOMMU at all
-      (e.g. because you have < 3 GB memory).
-      Kernel boot message: "PCI-DMA: Disabling IOMMU"
-
-   2. <arch/x86/kernel/amd_gart_64.c>: AMD GART based hardware IOMMU.
-      Kernel boot message: "PCI-DMA: using GART IOMMU"
-
-   3. <arch/x86_64/kernel/pci-swiotlb.c> : Software IOMMU implementation. Used
-      e.g. if there is no hardware IOMMU in the system and it is need because
-      you have >3GB memory or told the kernel to us it (iommu=soft))
-      Kernel boot message: "PCI-DMA: Using software bounce buffering
-      for IO (SWIOTLB)"
-
-::
-
-  iommu=[<size>][,noagp][,off][,force][,noforce]
-  [,memaper[=<order>]][,merge][,fullflush][,nomerge]
-  [,noaperture]
-
-General iommu options:
-
-    off
-      Don't initialize and use any kind of IOMMU.
-    noforce
-      Don't force hardware IOMMU usage when it is not needed. (default).
-    force
-      Force the use of the hardware IOMMU even when it is
-      not actually needed (e.g. because < 3 GB memory).
-    soft
-      Use software bounce buffering (SWIOTLB) (default for
-      Intel machines). This can be used to prevent the usage
-      of an available hardware IOMMU.
-
-iommu options only relevant to the AMD GART hardware IOMMU:
-
-    <size>
-      Set the size of the remapping area in bytes.
-    allowed
-      Overwrite iommu off workarounds for specific chipsets.
-    fullflush
-      Flush IOMMU on each allocation (default).
-    nofullflush
-      Don't use IOMMU fullflush.
-    memaper[=<order>]
-      Allocate an own aperture over RAM with size 32MB<<order.
-      (default: order=1, i.e. 64MB)
-    merge
-      Do scatter-gather (SG) merging. Implies "force" (experimental).
-    nomerge
-      Don't do scatter-gather (SG) merging.
-    noaperture
-      Ask the IOMMU not to touch the aperture for AGP.
-    noagp
-      Don't initialize the AGP driver and use full aperture.
-    panic
-      Always panic when IOMMU overflows.
-
-iommu options only relevant to the software bounce buffering (SWIOTLB) IOMMU
-implementation:
-
-    swiotlb=<slots>[,force,noforce]
-      <slots>
-        Prereserve that many 2K slots for the software IO bounce buffering.
-      force
-        Force all IO through the software TLB.
-      noforce
-        Do not initialize the software TLB.
-
-
-Miscellaneous
-=============
-
-  nogbpages
-    Do not use GB pages for kernel direct mappings.
-  gbpages
-    Use GB pages for kernel direct mappings.
-
-
-AMD SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization)
-=========================================
-Options relating to AMD SEV, specified via the following format:
-
-::
-
-   sev=option1[,option2]
-
-The available options are:
-
-   debug
-     Enable debug messages.
-
-   nosnp
-     Do not enable SEV-SNP (applies to host/hypervisor only). Setting
-     'nosnp' avoids the RMP check overhead in memory accesses when
-     users do not want to run SEV-SNP guests.

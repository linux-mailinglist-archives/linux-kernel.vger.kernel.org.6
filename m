No, Zen 5 is faster than the other CPUs.  I looked more into what was happening,
and it turns out it's actually executing more than 3 crc32q in parallel on
average, by overlapping the execution of different calls to crc_pcl().  If I
chain the CRC values, that goes away and the 4x unrolling no longer helps.

Of course, whether users are chaining the CRC values or not is up to the user.
A user might be checksumming lots of small messages, or they might be
checksumming a large message in smaller pieces.

I do think the 4x unrolling is probably worth keeping around to reduce
dependency on microarchitectural details for future-proofing.  It's quite modest
compared to the 128x unrolling that was used before...

That's correct.  It seems that 3 ALUs on Zen 5 can do crc32.

Well, data is rarely checksummed on its own but rather immediately before using
it or right after generating it.  In those cases it needs to be pulled into L1
cache, or has already been pulled into L1 cache, anyway.

Yes, it's an interesting idea.  There would need to be a separate bufend pointer
for each chunk set up.

Hi Paul,

In general, if a subsystem is willing to take Rust-related patches
through their tree, that is the ideal scenario! So please definitely
feel free to pick it up on your side (and thanks!); otherwise, I can
pick it up with your Acked-by.

Some days ago I wrote a summary of the usual discussion we have around
this (copy-pasting here for convenience):

    So far, what we have been doing is ask maintainers, first, if they
    would be willing take the patches themselves -- they are the experts
    of the subsystem, know what changes are incoming, etc. Some subsystems
    have done this (e.g. KUnit). That is ideal, because the goal is to
    scale and allows maintainers to be in full control.

    Of course, sometimes maintainers are not fully comfortable doing that,
    since they may not have the bandwidth, or the setup, or the Rust
    knowledge. In those cases, we typically ask if they would be willing
    to have a co-maintainer (i.e. in their entry, e.g. like locking did),
    or a sub-maintainer (i.e. in a new entry, e.g. like block did), that
    would take care of the bulk of the work from them.

    I think that is a nice middle-ground -- the advantage of doing it like
    that is that you get the benefits of knowing best what is going on
    without too much work (hopefully), and it may allow you to get more
    and more involved over time and confident on what is going on with the
    Rust callers, typical issues that appear, etc. Plus the sub-maintainer
    gets to learn more about the subsystem, its timelines, procedures,
    etc., which you may welcome (if you are looking for new people to get
    involved).

    I think that would be a nice middle-ground. As far as I understand,
    Andreas would be happy to commit to maintain the Rust side as a
    sub-maintainer (for instance). He would also need to make sure the
    tree builds properly with Rust enabled and so on. He already does
    something similar for Jens. Would that work for you?

    You could take the patches directly with his RoBs or Acked-bys, for
    instance. Or perhaps it makes more sense to take PRs from him (on the
    Rust code only, of course), to save you more work. Andreas does not
    send PRs to anyone yet, but I think it would be a good time for him to
    start learning how to apply patches himself etc.

    If not, then the last fallback would be putting it in the Rust tree as
    a sub-entry or similar.

    I hope that clarifies (and thanks whatever you decide!).

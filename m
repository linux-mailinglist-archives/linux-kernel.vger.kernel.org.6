Subject: [PATCH] perf vendor events arm64: Update N2/V2 events from source
Date: Wed, 20 Nov 2024 14:37:31 +0000
Message-Id: <20241120143739.243728-1-james.clark@linaro.org>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.34.1
Precedence: bulk
X-Mailing-List: linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
List-Id: <linux-kernel.vger.kernel.org>
List-Subscribe: <mailto:linux-kernel+subscribe@vger.kernel.org>
List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:linux-kernel+unsubscribe@vger.kernel.org>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Update using the new data [1] for these changes:

  * Scale some metrics like dtlb_walk_ratio to percent so they display
    better with Perf's 2 dp precision
  * Description typos, grammar and clarifications
  * Unnecessary metric formula brackets seem to have been removed in the
    source but this is not a functional change
  * New sve_all_percentage metric

The following command was used to generate this commit:

$ telemetry-solution/tools/perf_json_generator/generate.py \
  tools/perf/ --telemetry-files \
  telemetry-solution/data/pmu/cpu/neoverse/neoverse-v2.json:neoverse-n2-v2

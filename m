Well me getting this wrong, i.e. not noticing that in that case SA_ENCRYPT
is not passed, is a sign that hmac is wrong choice... I.e. my mistake
proves an argument here ;-)

Module params is what you should use in LKM's unless you have special
reason to use __setup(). It's a kernel-wide global where as this flag
is TPM driver only.

You need to just namespace it with "tpm." when passing throug kernel
command-line i.e. "tpm.pcr_integrity=3D1" (or whatever, open for naming
suggestions).

If firmware goes out of its way to describe the system incorrectly then 
I'd consider that all bets are off, and there's little point in us 
trying to guess how to cope with a contradiction. For all we know, it 
could be that the stall property is in fact genuine and it's the ATS 
capability that was advertised erroneously.

Unfortunately we can't do that, because there *are* RCiEP devices whose 
data interfaces are native AMBA, and thus for whom stalling is not 
actually a protocol violation as it would be on a real PCIe transport 
layer; correspondingly, it's *because* they are not true PCIe devices 
that they can't support ATS, and thus need stall support in order to do 
SVA, so things should still work out OK in practice.

It's not a GPU: drivers/crypto/hisilicon/zip/

Thanks,

How many input pins are there on the hardware block? It makes sense that
only one pin would be used in practice, but I'm wondering if there are
multiple pins in general. Why is the field called CMN_PLL_REFCLK_INDEX
if it's not picking the reference clk desired (i.e. the pin that is
actually connected)?

struct clk_parent_data doesn't pass parent rate information to the
clk_ops. I'd like you to not use any clk consumer APIs (clk.h) if
possible.

Yes, this makes sense if the clk actually has multiple possible parents.
Don't read the rate of the clk in the clk_ops::set_parent() callback
though. The callback should only program the hardware to select the
parent based on the index passed to the clk_op.

If the clk only has one possible parent then it's different. I'd do it
through clk_ops::set_rate() and use assigned-clock-rates or just let the
first child clk of the PLL set the rate and configure the PLL by having
the PLL's determine_rate() callback figure out if the parent rate is
valid.

That register field with "index" makes me suspicious that this is a mux
that we're trying to hide behind the parent rate. Quite possibly that's
actually a hardware multiplier, i.e. l-val, and we need to set the index
to pick which multiplier is used to achieve whatever frequency is
desired for the PLL itself. I assume the 353MHz output clk is actually
the one that is deciding what the index should be, and the other ones
all fall out of the PLL somewhere else through a post-divider or
something.

What frequency does the PLL run at?

>=20

No, it isn't acceptable.

Fwiw, I believe the original vision was seen as being flawed - at
least that's what's come up in discussions I've had and Google has a
policy to avoid legacy events. Specifically, a legacy event like
instructions or branch-misses what could go wrong? Well does the
instructions count contain speculatively executed instructions or not?
Similarly for branch-misses. Cache misses, can they be speculative or
not? The idea that there can be a counter and it gives just one value
across vendors and models just doesn't exist in practice. On ARM in
their json you'll see INST_RETIRED and INST_SPEC to deal with this,
the exact behavior of the event can be seen in its description. What
about the legacy instructions event? Well there's no description but
it happens that it is mapped onto the retired instruction count, as it
is for Intel. So the PMUs are trying for some consistency but you are
crossing your fingers. If a PMU lacked a retired instruction count
then why not use the speculative instruction count?

If you look at the events for perf stat -ddd, on the well supported
Intel (Skylake) and AMD (Turin):
Supported on both:
instructions, cycles, branches, branch-misses, L1-dcache-loads,
L1-dcache-load-misses, L1-icache-load-misses, dTLB-loads,
dTLB-load-misses, iTLB-loads, iTLB-load-misses.
Supported only on Intel:
LLC-loads, LLC-load-misses - presumably LLC means L2, so the event
name is misleading
Supported only on AMD:
stalled-cycles-frontend, stalled-cycles-backed, L1-icache-loads,
L1-dcache-prefetches
Supported on neither:
L1-dcache-prefetch-misses

For metrics we added the "Default" metric group to deal with this
diversity. I think "Default" also makes sense for events as:
1) it is more intention revealing to have a json event with a
description rather than legacy event,
2) we can avoid events like branches and branch-misses that cause
multiplexing on Intel p-cores when gathered with TopdownL1  (another
surprise is this combination hides the multiplexing percentages),
3) legacy events just don't really make sense when we're asking for
something (by default) like L1-dcache-prefetch-misses and no PMUs
support it,
4) we can optionally set precision on events. People seem to be wildly
ignorant of what precision architectures support, such as Linus
copying cycles:ppp from Intel to ARM and expecting the ppps to
actually mean something. Arguably it would be a service if perf failed
if a precision greater than the PMU's max_precise is given - that's
not practical given how precision works for AMD.

Anyway, the idea that legacy events should make a comeback, this is
best achieved, as ARM do, by having standard json events with standard
names. Losing descriptions and adding ambiguity with kernel tables is
a step backward imo.

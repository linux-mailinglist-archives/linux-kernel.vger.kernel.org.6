IMHO, it may be better to continue to review this small series and make
it ready to be merged (or dropped) ASAP?  I can put it as a high
priority task.  After all, this series begins with code or ideas from
Dan.

However, this is only my personal opinion, if community thinks that it
isn't a good idea, I can drop this series, at least the part that
duplicates with Alejandro's series.

Yes.  More coordination is good.

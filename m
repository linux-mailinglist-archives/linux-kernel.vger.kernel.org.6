Yeah, since this is all per-cpu data at this point rather than per-vCPU,
it isn't the end of the world to use a few extra bytes.

Agreed, the biggest thing I'd want to see in the exported interfaces
like this is to have enable/disable helpers to tell KVM when a driver
wants KVM to start/stop managing a piece of state while in a guest.

Then the hypervisor code can blindly save/restore some opaque values to
whatever registers it needs to update.

Ack, I had the blinders on that we cared only about TRBE here.

Skipped since I slapped this together in a hurry.

The protected mode hypervisor will need two bits of information.
Detecting that the feature is present can be done in the kernel so long
as the corresponding static key / cpucap is toggled before we drop
privileges.

Whether or not it is programmable + enabled is a decision that must be
made by observing hardware state from the hypervisor before entering a
guest.

KVM manages the same piece of state (TRFCR_EL1) either way though right?

The expectation I had is that KVM is informed any time a trace session
(TRBE or otherwise) is enabled/disabled on a CPU, likely with a TRFCR_EL1
of 0 if guest mode is excluded.

The function names might need massaging, but I was hoping to have a
single set of enable/disable knobs to cover all bases here.

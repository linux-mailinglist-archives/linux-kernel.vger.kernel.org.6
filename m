I don't think it is documented, it might only be a verbal convention at
the moment. Although [1] is suggesting `new` for general constructors.
Since this is the only constructor, one could argue that the
recommendation is to use `new` (which I personally find a good idea).

But this is not enough for it to be sound, right? You create an `ARef`
from `bd.rq`, which potentially lives forever. You somehow need to
require that the pointer `bd` stays valid for reads and (synchronized)
writes until the request is ended (probably via `blk_mq_end_request`).

Seems like you already want to use this here :)

I think you need a safety requirement on the function: `rq` points to a
valid `Request`. Then you could just use `Request::wrapper_ptr` instead
of the line below.

Alice used it a couple of times, eg in [2]. I plan on putting it in the
safety standard.

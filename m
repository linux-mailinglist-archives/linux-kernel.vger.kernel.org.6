I think we can address this when/if implementing preservation for hugetlbfs
and it will be tricky. 
If hugetlb in the first kernel uses a lot of memory, we just won't have
enough scratch space for early hugetlb reservations in the second kernel
regardless of hugetlb_cma. On the other hand, we already have the preserved
hugetlbfs memory, so we'd probably need to reserve less memory in the
second kernel.

But anyway, it's completely different discussion about how to preserve
hugetlbfs.

In the current form KHO does relies on vmemmap being allocated, but it does
not rely on it being initialized. Marking memblock ranges NOINT ensures
nothing touches the corresponding struct pages and KHO can use their fields
up to the point the memory is returned to KHO callers.

It does. 
memmap_init_reserved_pages() is called always, no matter of
CONFIG_DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT is set or not and it skips initialization
of NOINIT regions.

These days memmap contents is unstable because of the folio/memdesc
project, but in general carrying memory map data from kernel to kernel is
indeed something to consider.

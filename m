Just let me know what's the most convenient; if mail it is I won't
bother :)

Yes; this commit adds the out of bound access.

I didn't see hte list of files anywhere for this, does it depend on the
commit?
(not that it's a problem to look at the commits referenced, I don't
think we'll automate anything for the forseeable future)

Sure, I'll take a min to finish the patches and send them on Monday;
might as well use work time when I've got an excuse to do kernel stuff.

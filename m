I think I managed to get behind the calculation of the fractional-n 
divider parameters. I came up with a spreadsheet to calculate the output 
frequency from existing register values and I have a crude Python script 
that can be used to search for parameters for a given pixel clock.

I tested this with three different non-CEA-861 pixel clock values 
(supported by my HDMI USB grabber) for which the integer PLL yielded 
deviations >0.5%. With the new LUT entries those modes work now.

I will clean things up a bit and then share what I have. I hope that 
this allows anyone to calculate parameters for their non-standard 
displays if required.

If someone feels extra motivated they could try to calculate the 
fractional parameters at runtime. However I'm not sure that this is 
feasible. The numerical computation of a large number of parameters is 
quite heavy and it's probably not easy to strip the algorithm down to 
something that can be run on the target without too much overhead.

For what I found out the factor of 5 always applies. For the integer 
part and also for the fractional part.

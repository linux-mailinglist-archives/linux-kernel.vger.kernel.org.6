Umm, so you think someone is going to do multibuffer hashing with more buffers
than kmap_local supports (16)?  Why?  Regardless of the exact API, that case
would require kmap() to support.  It's hard to see how it would ever be worth
it, even if theoretically a CPU was capable of taking advantage of that much
instruction-level parallelism (this is implausible with SHA-256 instructions)
and ignoring the other issues like code size bloat and increased memory usage
that a very high interleaving factor would cause.

Of course, in practice this is just going to be used with 2x, which is what CPUs
can actually do with the SHA-256 instructions and avoids the various downsides
of overly-large interleaving factors.

Which is incorrect and just shows that you still haven't even read the code.
Take a look at cf715f4b7eb521a5bf67d391387b754c2fcde8d2.  Switching dm-verity to
always "map" the data blocks significantly simplified the dm-verity code (-138
line diffstat), *even before switching to shash*.  So we really want to just
pass virtual addresses to the crypto API too.  It's much simpler.

Compression and hashing are not the same and use different APIs.  So this is a
straw man.  But I think you are on the wrong track for compression too.  What
zswap needs is relatively limited: only the compressed data (not the
uncompressed data) can be split across pages, and only 2 pages.  A complex API
with source and destination scatterlists isn't needed for this use case either,
even assuming that the best solution is to make all the compression algorithms
support this "natively" (most don't yet, or don't support it efficiently).
Other solutions that could be faster include just continuing to linearize the
data, or rethinking zswap to not create non-linear compressed data in the first
place, e.g. by putting compressed data only in large folios.

And yes, the zswap patchset is using request chaining, but that's because you
forced the zswap people to use it.  It wasn't their original proposal.  And
based on the discussions and various versions of the patchset, they've been
having quite a bit of trouble making sense of your API.

But again, this is compression, not hashing.  They don't use the same API.

I've given you extensive constructive feedback over the past year, while you've
continued to nack my patches for inconsistent and bogus reasons.

But when there is only one such contribution, why overengineer it with something
that is slower, more complex, more error-prone, and harder to maintain?
Especially when this is a kernel-internal API that we can change whenever we
want to suit what is actually being used in the kernel.

And your vague plan to use multibuffer hashing in IPsec doesn't count.  I keep
explaining why it doesn't actually make sense, and how I've *actually* been
optimizing IPsec in other ways that actually matter and actually work, but you
haven't been listening.

I'd love for your work to make my patches obsolete, but unfortunately your
version is just worse.  And besides it being very incomplete, the main issue is
fundamental with the design.  So it doesn't really make sense to use it,
especially when I'm going to get stuck cleaning up your mess again.

And there is also still time for you to add comments.  ;-)

Redundant memory barriers can be OK, but only if they make the algorithm
easier to understand, as we found in SRCU.  It is not clear that these
fit that bill, or, alternatively, that appropriate comments wouldn't be
an improvement over the redundant memory barrier.

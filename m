I view your work as hopelessly naive because I've seen the basic idea
fail spectacularly so many times. That includes things I have written,
such as the Datastate LSM.

... and don't play the stodgy old fart card on me. I've been working
on making the LSM more available to new security models for years.

New good ideas can shatter old conceptions. Old bad ideas with a fresh
coat of paint and impressive new terminology fail to impress.

Squirrels are funny rodents. If you model their behavior you will declare
that they are herbivores. In California (where many strange and wonderful
things happen) squirrels have begun to eat voles, a very carnivorous
behavior. If you believe in modeling as a way to identify correct behavior,
you have to say that these furry creatures that eat voles are not squirrels.
If, on the other hand, you look at the environment they live in you can see
that the loss of native habitat has reduced the available fat calories to
the point where survival requires changed behavior. They're still squirrels,
and no amount of modeling is going to change that.

It's a poor workman who blames his tools. Why haven't audit and audit2allow
been enhanced to provide the information necessary to create your analysis?
I suggest that it's because the value has been recognized as unimportant.

And how is that different from running SELinux in permissive mode?

Sigh. You keep coming back to a train of logic that is based on a flawed
assumption. If you accept that observed behavior describes intended
behavior the arguments that follow may be convincing. I, for one, do not
accept that assumption.

cycles was a bad event name, dsu is a terrible name for what is mainly
the l3 cache, the risk that the two are combined get broken I'm fine
with as neoverse users with uncore permissions are say much rarer than
Apple M users. Having a cycles and a bus_cycles event is already
ambiguous, they sound the same. Renaming cycles to cpu_cycles would be
best.

No idea, iirc Mark Rutland requested not to use legacy events for Apple M.

The sysfs and json event handling is interwoven, for example you can
add to a sysfs event with json information. There are basically two
approaches in the event parser, hardcoded legacy things and event
names (optionally with PMU names). I'm trying to get rid of the
hardcoded legacy things as they were fine when you had a single core
type, but I want to have events everywhere - say instructions and
cycles on a GPU so we can IPC on a GPU. For RISC-V as long as the
legacy events are covered as names in json and json/sysfs has priority
over legacy then things will be fine.

The priority for events with a PMU is the sysfs/json has a priority
over legacy names, so I don't understand what you're saying here. Your
example shouldn't be broken. The revert is for the case where no PMU
is specified, where the priority is the opposite which is at best
inconsistent.

Which change? If the change is trying to use "cycles" to open on all
PMUs because it will be wild carded then it will run into the priority
issue.

Perhaps it is other legacy events, not cycles and instructions. There
must have been a reason for this regression report but I don't have an
Apple M CPU to test on.

Thanks,

We have done a similar scheme before, and on some architectures (not 
x86) the RMW is slightly cheaper than the mb.

Your reasoning is a bit simplified because it seems to assume a stronger 
concept of ordering than LKMM has, but even with LKMM's ordering your 
code seems fine.

I feel it can even be simplified a little, the hazard bit does not seem 
necessary.

Assuming atomic operations for everything racy, relaxed unless stated 
otherwise:

(R)eader:

    old = read p // I don't think this needs acq, because of address 
dependencies (*)
    haz ||=_acq old
    if (read p != old) retry;
    *old

(W)riter:

    p =_??? ... // assuming we don't set it to null this needs a rel
    --- mb ---
    haz ||= 0
    while (read_acq haz == old) retry;
    delete old


In order to get a use-after-free, both of the  R:read p  need to read 
before  W:p = ... , so because of the W:mb, they execute before  W:haz||=0 .

Also, for the use-after-free,  W:read_acq haz  needs to read before (the 
write part of)  R:haz||=_acq old .


Then the  W:haz ||= 0  also needs to read before (the write part of) 
R:haz||=_acq old  because of coherence on the same location.

Since both of them are atomic RMW, the  W:haz||= 0  also needs to write 
before (the write part of)  R:haz||=_acq old , and in the absence of 
non-RMW writes (so assuming no thread will just store to the hazard 
pointer), this implies that the latter reads-from an rmw-sequence-later 
store than  W:haz||=0 , which therefore executes before  R:haz||=_acq old .

But because of the acquire barrier,  R:haz||=_acq old  executes before 
the second  R:read p .


This gives a cycle
    (2nd)R:read p  ->xb  W:haz||=0  ->xb  R:haz||=_acq  ->xb  (2nd)R:read p

and therefore is forbidden.

Note that in this argument, the two  R:read p  are not necessarily 
reading from the same store. Because of ABA, it can happen that they 
read from distinct stores and see the same value.

It does require clearing hazard pointers with an RMW like atomic_and(0) 
(**). The combination of the two RMW (for setting & clearing the hazard 
pointer) might in total be slower again than an mb.


(I took the liberty to add an acquire barrier in the writer's while loop 
for the case where we read from the (not shown) release store of the 
reader that clears the hazard pointer. It's arguable whether that acq is 
needed since one could argue that a delete is a kind of store, in which 
case control dependency would handle it.)

have fun,
   jonas


(*
   you talk about sandwiching, and the data dependency does guarantee 
some weaker form of sandwiching than the acq, but I don't think 
sandwiching is required at all. If you happened to be able to set the 
hazard pointer before reading the pointer, that would just extend the 
protected area, wouldn't it?
)

(**
I think if you clear the pointer with a store, the hazard bit does not 
help. You could be overwriting the hazard bit, and the RMWs that set the 
hazard bit might never propagate to your CPU.

Also in your code you probably meant to clear the whole hazard pointer 
in the retry code of the reader, not just the hazard bit.)

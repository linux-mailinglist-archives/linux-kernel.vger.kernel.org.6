Is this a mainline behavior? Hotplug is not considered a normal operation . And
a CPU not being active is not something I am aware of in mainline behavior
aside from hotplug.

I think you're referring to a platform specific out-of-tree feature that is not
part of mainline linux.

Sorry if I missed your reply elsewhere. But if you don't want the
rq_affinity=1 and do your custom routing, why rq_affinity=0 isn't the right
solution for custom routing behavior?

This is not an IO specific problem. Tasks that need more performance will have
to wait for utilization to grow quickly. I don't see this is a problem related
to rq_affinity=1 behavior but a generic scheduler behavior issues that is
outside of block layer.

So in this case you want rq_affinity=0?

And on this different system you want rq_affinity=1?

I still don't see why you must use rq_affinity=1 for your custom routing which
AFAICT is outside of the supported realm. We have no clue this is contention or
not. It seems you have other larger logic that does custom software in many
layers and I don't think what you're doing is part of what's supported.

Could you help contributing patches to help detect contention problems and how
we can differentiate between the two scenarios instead of hacking rq_affinity=1
?

This is a userspace knob. I don't think the expectation to ship one
configuration for all SoCs...

Why you can't modify the value based on the SoC? The only thing I am gathering
from your arguments is that you can't modify rq_affinity to suit the setup the
SoC requires, but I don't get why.

Are these in tree drivers? I'd love to learn how the use case is detected
generically if this is in tree.

How come? The LLC is shared on mid and little. It wouldn't make a difference
which CPU handles it to take advantage of LLC. What did I miss?

This is a hack to workaround the fact that you seem to not want or for some
reason I am unable to get yet can't change rq_affinity setup to suit the need
of the platform.

AFAICT we don't have any knowledge about contentions to automatically decide
the best way to route handling completion. It'd be a welcome addition if you
have a solution that can teach the system to handle this automatically. But in
your case it seems you have a lot of custom setup that is not part of usual
upstream handling and would like just to keep backward compatibility for
reasons I am unable to make sense of yet :(

Yeah, I couldn't either with ARM boards I have, I think we should revert
the change, as per Linus bisect and test that it makes thing work the
way they were before that patch for him and get this work restarted as
the first thing in the next devel cycle.

It has to be widely tested, Ian tried, Linus tried his patch and it is
still not acceptable, its a holiday, kids are home, we should be with
family.

Indeed, the situation was detailed to a wider audience, hybrid is a
reality and we should properly support it, taming perf's tech debit on
this matter.

Ian's has been working on this for long time, testing all this takes a
lot of time and requires access to lots of hardware not easily available
for all of us, so its bound to break here and there, what we do when
this happens depends on when the problem is detected, and today Linus is
expected to close the merge window, so a revert is the technical, if not
pleasant thing to do now.

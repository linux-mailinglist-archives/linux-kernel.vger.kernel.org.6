hyp_ffa_init() only issues FFA_VERSION afaict, which is the one call
that you're allowed to make during negotiation. So the existing code is
fine.

I think that's also fine. The FFA code in the hypervisor exists solely
to proxy requests from the host; it's not used for anything else and so,
from the host's persective, FFA should behave identically to the case in
which the proxy is not present (e.g. if we were just using VHE). That
means that we're doing the right thing by deferring to the host for
version negotation.

Are you saying there's a bug in the current code if the host negotiates
the downgrade?

I strongly disagree with that. The hypervisor isn't using FFA for
anything other than proxying the host and so we don't need to negotiate
a separate version.

What would we gain by doing this? Is there a bug with what we're doing
at the moment?

Why is this beneficial? It just looks like complexity at EL2 for no gain
to me, but maybe I'm missing something.

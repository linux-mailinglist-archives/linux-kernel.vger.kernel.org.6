At least I haven't found against what it is ordering the dynticks counter here.

It is still time to discard the patches :-)

Yes and it's not so much for optimization purpose, like you said it's
not a fast-path, although in the case of fqs round scan it _might_ be
debatable in the presence of hurry callbacks, but I use those changes
more for documentation purpose. My opinion on that being that having
memory barriers when they are not necessary doesn't help reviewers and
doesn't bring the incentive to actually verify that the ordering is
correct when it is really required, since there is so much of it
everywhere anyway. I'd rather have a clear, well visible and precise
picture. But that's just personal belief.

Sure, but it's a bet. That one day a younger person will buy it from me
double the price ;-)

Thanks.

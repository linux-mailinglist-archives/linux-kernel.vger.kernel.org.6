Doesn't most of the discussion stem from this particular point? I also 
understood it that way, that risc-v folks agreed it was better to 
support these to make all existing software work, not just Perf.

Maybe one issue was calling them 'legacy' events in the first place, and 
I'm not sure if there is complete consensus that these are legacy. Can't 
they continue be the short easy list of events likely to be common 
across platforms? If there is an issue with some of them being wrong in 
some places we can move forward from that by making sure new platforms 
do it right, rather than changing the logic for everyone to fix that bug.

For the argument that Google prefers to use the sysfs events because of 
these differences, I don't think there is anything preventing that kind 
of use today? Or at least not for the main priority flip proposed, but 
maybe there are some smaller adjacent bugs that can be fixed up separately.

Thanks
James

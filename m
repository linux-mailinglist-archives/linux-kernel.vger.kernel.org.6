mpt3sas and mpi3mr do not use any libata code at all, the SCSI to ATA
Translation (SAT) is done completely by the HBA, so from a Linux
perspective, we are issuing SCSI commands to the HBA.

We can see that libsas uses ata_std_qc_defer() as its .qc_defer callback:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.11-rc7/drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_ata.c#L566


If you look at SATA 3.a Gold specification,
"13.6.3 Intermixing Non-NCQ commands and NCQ commands"

"The host shall not issue a non-NCQ command while an NCQ command is outstanding."


In AHCI 1.3.1 specification,
"1.7 Theory of Operation"

"System software is responsible to ensure that queued and non-queued commands
are not mixed in the command list for the same device with the exception of
the NCQ Unload command."


Usually, tools like smartctl submit SCSI commands of type "ATA-16 passthrough",
which is a specific SCSI command that just contains a regular ATA command as
payload:
https://www.smartmontools.org/browser/trunk/smartmontools/scsiata.cpp?desc=1&order=date#L346

For a "ATA-16 passthrough" SCSI command, libata will simply copy the fields
from the "ATA-16 passthrough" SCSI command to the appropriate field in a newly
created ATA command, see the SAT specification and:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v6.11-rc7/drivers/ata/libata-scsi.c#L2878-L2887


See also the SAT-6 specification,
"6.2.4 Mechanism for processing some commands as NCQ commands"

"The ACS-5 standard defines a mechanism for NCQ encapsulation of some commands.
Use of this mechanism allows these commands to be processed without quiescing
the ATA device."

Without considering if it is a good idea or not, it should be possible to
translate some commands to instead use the "NCQ encapsulated" variant of
the ATA command that was used in the "ATA-16 passthrough" SCSI command.

However looking at e.g.:
https://www.smartmontools.org/browser/trunk/smartmontools/scsiata.cpp?desc=1&order=date#L566
smartctl is sending a IDENTIFY DEVICE (ECh) ATA command,
and this command has no NCQ encapsulated variant.

(Had the application instead used a READ LOG DMA EXT command to read the
IDENTIFY DEVICE data log, where log page 01h is a copy of IDENTIFY DEVICE data,
we would have been able to convert the command to an NCQ encapsulated variant.)



TL;DR: I do not see easy generic solution to this problem.

To be able to send a non-queued command, there has to be no NCQ commands queued
on the device. I guess you could implement a scheduler that would be quiescing
the queue, processes the non-queued command, and then thaw the queue, but that
would essentially make non-queued commands high priority commands, and could
thus be used to seriously limit throughput by just sending some non-queued
commands every now and then :)


Kind regards,
Niklas

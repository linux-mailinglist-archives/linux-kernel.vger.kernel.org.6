I am very sorry that I sent the wrong subject which should add "RFC",
due to lack of experience.

Thanks for the correct of format.

It is conceptually a revert of the commit(revert the feature change in the
commit), but not in the git sense(revert the lines of code).

The next paragraph provides corresponding examples.

Thanks for the correct. In fact, this is copied from others reply.

Bypass security_mmap_file() is enough for an attack for SELinux.

As with the position of security_vm_enough_memory_mm(), the LSM hook must
be placed in a __internal__ position to avoid bypassing as mentioned in
the two examples, which can lead to serious security issues.

SELinx and many other mandatory access controls(MAC) rely on LSM hooks.
MAC is not a shallow interception of user-facing like seccomp, it is
__not__ a DAC. In fact, SELinux also restricts some internal behaviors
of the kernel (the SELinux label for the kernel is usually `u:r:kernel:s0`
). Yes, in the sense of DAC, the kernel certainly has full permission.
But MAC must prevent user space code implicitly triggering the internal
behavior of the kernel, which can be expolit by attackers.

Do such a change is also suggested by LSM maintainer in the fix of [1].

Yes, this patch should be marked as a RFC, not request for merge immediatel=
y.

This is not a fix for these two links, but a further measure taken to avoid=
 the
recurrence of such fixed issues.

This is mentioned in patch.

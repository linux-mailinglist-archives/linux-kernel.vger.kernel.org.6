In the beginning, we wanted it for the RISC-V ecosystem because we had
an opportunity to start
from a clean slate and attempt a better implementation. However, the
burden of supporting the existing
existing users who try to run their preferred way of profiling
applications by using
legacy events (especially cycle/instructions) are forcing us to follow
the convention (have the encodings specified in the driver as well.
) unfortunately.

However, we can add the encodings under a Kconfig which can be
disabled or removed in the future if we get
to a point where there are no legacy users.

Apart from the non-Linux guests using SBI PMU events, the host
hypervisor(also running Linux) may need
event mapping available in the driver for the following reasons even
for guests running Linux.

1. The guest Linux is not running the updated perf tool with the
correct json file
2. VMM wants to fake the unique identifiers (vendorid, archid, implid)
for migration or some
other reasons.

Both these use cases are probably corner cases at best. That's why, I
am inclined to keep the encoding
in the driver to begin with with the hope we won't need to serve these
use cases in the future.

The driver will use the raw events coming from json as a preferred
method for all the events anyways. In that case,
the hypervisor doesn't have to do anything apart from filtering. In
absence of it, the events are encoded as legacy
(HARDWARE or HARDWARE_CACHE) and the hypervisor will try its best to
map those to a platform specific encoding.

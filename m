Hi all,

Looking at this from a different angle: what does the bad blocks system
actually gain in modern environments?  All the physical storage devices
I can think of (including all HDDs and SSDs, NVME or otherwise) have
internal mechanisms for remapping faulty blocks, and therefore
unrecoverable blocks don't become visible to the Linux kernel level
until after the physical storage device has exhausted its internal
supply of replacement blocks.  At that point the physical device is
already catastrophically failing, and in the case of SSDs will likely
have already transitioned to a read-only state.  Using bad-blocks at the
kernel level to map around additional faulty blocks at this point does
not seem to me to have any benefit, and the device is unlikely to be
even marginally usable for any useful length of time at that point anyway.

It seems to me that the bad-blocks capability is a legacy from the
distant past when HDDs did not do internal block remapping and hence the
kernel could usefully keep a disk usable by mapping out individual
blocks in software.
If this is the case and there isn't some other way that bad-blocks is
still beneficial, might it be better to drop it altogether rather than
implementing complex code to work around its effects?

Of course I'm happy to be corrected if there's still a real benefit to
having it, just because I can't see one doesn't mean there isn't one.

Regards,
Geoff.

Should we? No.

*NONE* of the events in your example are CPU-bound, and the call to
armpmu_event_init() can happen on an arbitrary CPU which the relevant
event never actually runs on, while other unrelated events may run on
that CPU.

It makes no sense for armv8pmu_set_event_filter() to write to a per-cpu
structure. That's purely there to determine what the filters *should* be
when *that specific event* is programmed into hardware.

As Rob and I have pointed out already, the *only* thing that can be
relevant to deciding the configuration of HW filtering is the set of
events which are *active* on that CPU.

As mentioned elsewhere, it's not a problem for x86, so why is it
magically a problem for arm64?

Imagine that there's an existing process with some pid ${PID}, and
concurrently, the following commands are run, either by the same user or
different users with appropriate permissions:

	# Trying to record user branches only
	perf record -j any,u -e cycles -p ${PID}

	# Trying to record kernel branches only
	perf record -j any,k -e cycles -p ${PID}

Whatever you do, the task trying to record user branches only will lose
some records:

* If we make the events mutually exclusive, the branches will only be
  recorded when the user event is installed.

* If we merge the HW filters and later apply a SW filter, it's very
  likely that kernel branches taken after exception entry have filled
  all the records, and there are no user branches left to sample.

If those functions are small, it's very likely that they'll all be in
the branch history. If they're so large that they're not executed in one
scheduling quantum, do you expect them to fall within the same event
period?

I think that you're making a big deal out of an edge case that doesn't
matter much in practice.

Mark.

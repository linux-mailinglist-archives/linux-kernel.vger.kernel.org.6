Given no workqueue work executed without being dequeued, any queued work,
regardless if they are more than 2048, that acquires cgroup_mutex could not
prevent the work queued by thread-T from being executed, so thread-T can
make safe forward progress, therefore with no chance left for the ABBA 
deadlock you spotted where lockdep fails to work.

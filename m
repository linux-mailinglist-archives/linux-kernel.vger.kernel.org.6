I figured as much - was just trying to point out that it semantically makes

ah, I completely forgot about those functions - though it should be worth
noting that wait_event_interruptible_locked_irq() actually drops the spinlo=
ck
before re-enabling interrupts. Though, it still re-enables interrupts - so
you're certainly correct there.

I had been asked by Benno to change it to by-value but it wasn't totally cl=
ear
to me either what the reasoning was.

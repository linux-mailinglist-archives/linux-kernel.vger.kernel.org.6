We can easily build abstractions that ensure that the address a driver is trying
to access is mapped properly, such that you can't have accidential out-of-bound
accesses.

Those can be implemented by the corresponding subsystem / bus that the resource
originates from.

In fact, we already have abstractions for that on the way, a generic I/O
abstraction [1] as base implementation and a specific abstraction for PCI bars
[2].

Of course, if the MMIO region comes from let's say the device tree, we still
have to assume that the information in the DT is correct, but the driver does
not need unsafe code for this.

That sounds perfectly valid to me.

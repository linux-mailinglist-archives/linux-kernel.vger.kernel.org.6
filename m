Hi David,

Sorry for the late response on this thread. To be completely transparent
with you, I am not someone who inspects hugetlb usage on a regular
basis, so I may not have the most relevant insights when it comes to
how much utility there would be from breaking down the usage by size.

With that said, I believe that over the past couple of days, there have
been some responses on this thread regarding how others use hugetlb. As you
know, I share Johannes's opinion that if there are people who would benefit
from splitting up the hugetlb usage across different page sizes, it should
happen in the hugetlb controller.

This is a good point. With that said, I believe that this is an instance
of a feature where both of our proposed ideas can co-exist; we can have the
total hugetlb usage reported in memcg for now, and if there is a consensus 
/ majority that would like to see the breakdown as well, we can introduce
it in a future patch without breaking the utility of this patch.

To quickly address a potential concern of bloating the already large memcg
stat: including both the total and breakdown wouldn't be the first time
a stat and its breakdown are both included: there is a precedent with this
in slab_(un)reclaimable and slab.

This is true! I still think it would be nice to include the total anyways,
since for a lot of people who use this statistic (Nhat's response in this
thread and Shakeel's response in the v3 of this patch), all they want is
a quick check to see how much memory is being used by hugetlb so they can
reason about memory dynamics. Again, I think that if we are to include
a breakdown in a future patch, it can coexist with this one.

Sorry for the late reponse again. I think that if you had examples of use
cases where having the differnt page sizes, it would help me better
understand a motivation for including the breakdown (I would be happy
to write the patch for the breakdown as well if there is a consensus!)

Thank you for your thoughts, have a great day!
Joshua

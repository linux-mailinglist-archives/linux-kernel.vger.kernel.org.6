"Is it only EAS?"
I would hope so, EAS should be responsible for all placement in your
case.
Right, but potential latency costs are a side-effect of co-scheduling,
so I'm not sure I understand why you'd rather make EAS work for this
specific use-case instead of just disabling it for phases we know
it can't do the best job?
The entire post-EEVDF discussions are all about "Some workloads like
preemption, other's don't", but as long as we have plenty of idle
CPUs all that seems like unnecessary effort, am I missing something?

Christian

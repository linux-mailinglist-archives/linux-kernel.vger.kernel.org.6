As to Locality switching:
The call sequence is,
   tpm_pcr_extend -> tpm_find_get_ops -> tpm_try_get_ops ->
     tpm_chip_start -> if (chip->locality == -1) tpm_request_locality
And when the extend completes:
   out: tpm_put_ops -> tpm_chip_stop -> tpm_relinquish_locality ->
     chip->locality = -1;

We made slmodule set the locality value used by request/relinquish back 
to 0 when it was done with its initialization and then the sysfs nodes 
to allow the runtime to request it when it needed to send measurements. 
This is because we did not want to pin how it works to the one use case
currently focused on.

By definition I provided earlier, in our use case the initramfs is part 
of the TCB as it is embedded into the kernel. As to the locality roles, 
according to TPM Platform Profile:
  - Locality 2: Dynamically Launched OS (Dynamic OS) “runtime” environment.
  - Locality 1: An environment for use by the Dynamic OS.

I apologies for not expressing this clearer, as that statement is 
incorrect. The currently deployed use case works as follows:

[SRTM] --> [GRUB] -- (DLE, terminates SRTM chain) -->
   [CPU] -- (starts DRTM chain) --> [SINIT ACM] -->
   [SL kernel + initramfs] -- (load/measure/kexec) --> [target kernel]

As one can see, the SRTM is terminated and its components are not used 
in the DRTM chain. This model reproduces the tboot model, with several 
enhancements, including the ability for a single solution that supports 
and works on Intel, AMD, and we are currently enabling Arm. It is not 
the only model that can be used, which several were presented at 2020 
Plumbers. A detailed version of a deployed implementation of the secure 
upgrade use case was detailed in the 2021 FOSSDEM presentation. Where 
the LCP policy is used to tell the ACM what [SL kernel + initramfs] are 
allowed to be started by TXT. This allows the ability to launch into an 
upgrade state without having to reboot.

In case the question comes up from those not familiar, the kexec does an 
GETSEC[SEXIT] which closes off access to Localities 1 and 2, thus 
locking the DRTM PCR values. It brings the CPUs out of SMX mode so the 
target kernel does not require to have any knowledge about running in 
that mode.

v/r,

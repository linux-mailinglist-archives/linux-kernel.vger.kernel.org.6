Hi Huan,

I find this part surprising. Assuming the dmabuf memory doesn't first
go into a page pool (used for some buffers, not all) and actually does
get freed synchronously with fput, this would mean it gets sucked up
by other supposedly background processes before it can be allocated by
the preview process. I thought the preview process was the one most
desperate for memory? You mention file pages, but where is this
newly-freed memory actually going if not to the preview process? My
initial reaction was the same as Roman's that the PMC should be hooked
up to reclaim instead of depending on the reaper. But I think this
might suggest that wouldn't work because the system is under such high
memory pressure that it'd be likely reclaim would have emptied the
PMCs before the preview process could use it.

One more thing I find odd is that for this to work a significant
portion of your dmabuf pages would have to be order 0, but we're
talking about a ~500M buffer. Does whatever exports this buffer not
try to use higher order pages like here?

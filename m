NVMe namespaces are dynamic and can be created and deleted at will
at runtime.  I just don't see how they would even fit into OF
concepts.

There is a huge impedance mismatch here, to the point where I completely
fail to understand what you are trying to do.

Please point to a document describing how, but more importantly why
this is done.  I've worked with and maintained Linux PCI(e) drivers for
about 20 years and never seen it.  And the concept simply doesn't make
sense in terms of a dynamically probed bus.

NVMe Controllers are PCI functions (or virtual entities over the network).
Defining them in a static DT scheme does not make sense.  NVMe Namespaces
which are what contains the block data are dynamically discoverred and
can be created and deleted at runtime, so refering to them in DT is even
more broken.  I really don't see how any of this could remotely work.

If you aren't dealing with raw(ish) NAND don't use mtd.  MTD is designed
to deal with the nitty gritty details of NOR and NAND flash.  If you
already have an FTL running in the device there is absolutely no reason
to use it.

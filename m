AFAICT - HDFGRTR2_EL2 and HDFGWTR2_EL2 registers configure traps into EL2 when
accessed from EL1/EL0, provided all required EL3 trap controls are in place as
well. These EL2 based trap configs need to be set before the kernel finally
enters EL1. Although there is an assumption about EL3 based trap configs being
in place, do we need to mention that in commit message as well. Is not updating 
booting.rst takes care of all EL3 requirements.

There are many commits that changed __init_el2_fgt() with different description
formats. Do you have particular one in mind which can be followed here ? :)

Sure, will fix it.

Should not __init_el2_fgt2() remain separate to contain all future FEAT_FGT2
related trap enabled/disable checks ? OTOH reading id_aa64mmfr0_el1 register
should improve some performance as well.

Just to summerize what's being done in __init_el2_fgt()

.macro __init_el2_fgt
	...............
	mov     x0, xzr
	...............
.Lskip_spe_fgt_\@:
        msr_s   SYS_HDFGRTR_EL2, x0
        msr_s   SYS_HDFGWTR_EL2, x0
	...............
.Lset_fgt_\@:
        msr_s   SYS_HFGRTR_EL2, x0
        msr_s   SYS_HFGWTR_EL2, x0
        msr_s   SYS_HFGITR_EL2, xzr
	...............

If the relevant features are not present and their traps need not be handled,
all FEAT_FGT based trap control registers (SYS_HDFGRTR_EL2, SYS_HDFGWTR_EL2,
SYS_HFGRTR_EL2, SYS_HFGWTR_EL2 and SYS_HFGITR_EL2) get cleared. Hence same
needs to be done for all FEAT_FGT2 register as well. Fair enough, something
like the following makes sense ?

.macro __init_el2_fgt2
        mrs     x1, id_aa64mmfr0_el1
        ubfx    x1, x1, #ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1_FGT_SHIFT, #4
        cmp     x1, #ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1_FGT_FGT2
        b.lt    .Lskip_fgt2_\@

        mov     x0, xzr
        mrs     x1, id_aa64dfr0_el1
        ubfx    x1, x1, #ID_AA64DFR0_EL1_DebugVer_SHIFT, #4
        cmp     x1, #ID_AA64DFR0_EL1_DebugVer_V8P9
        b.lt    .Lskip_dbg_v8p9_\@

        orr     x0, x0, #HDFGWTR2_EL2_nMDSELR_EL1
.Lskip_dbg_v8p9_\@:
        msr_s   SYS_HDFGWTR2_EL2, x0
        msr_s   SYS_HDFGRTR2_EL2, x0
        msr_s   SYS_HFGRTR2_EL2, xzr
        msr_s   SYS_HFGWTR2_EL2, xzr
        msr_s   SYS_HFGITR2_EL2, xzr
.Lskip_fgt2_\@:
.endm

Just wondering - following the same principle if clearing these FEAT_FGT2 trap
registers would make sense in itself, even without FEAT_Debugv8p9 enablement ?

Something like the commit

commit 31c00d2aeaa2da89361f5b64a64ca831433be5fc
Author: Mark Brown <broonie@kernel.org>

    arm64: Disable fine grained traps on boot
    
    The arm64 FEAT_FGT extension introduces a set of traps to EL2 for accesses
    to small sets of registers and instructions from EL1 and EL0.  Currently
    Linux makes no use of this feature, ensure that it is not active at boot by
    disabling the traps during EL2 setup.

Not sure if I got this correctly. Are you suggesting to carve out __init_el2_fgt2()
from the series and post separately with PMUv3.9 requirements and fallback clearing
for all FEAT_FGT2 trap config registers as mentioned above ?

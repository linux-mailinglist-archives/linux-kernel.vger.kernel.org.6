I see. In that case, this fits better in the patch that actually adds
support for having multiple requests and buffers, and please call it out
explicitly in the commit message.

The constraint here is about zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() holding the mutex,
making an allocation which internally triggers reclaim, then recursing
into zswap and trying to hold the same mutex again causing a deadlock.

If zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() does not need to hold the mutex to begin
with, the constraint naturally goes away.

For compress/decompress to acquire the mutex they need to run on that
CPU, and I don't think that's possible before onlining completes, so
zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() must have already completed before
compress/decompress can use that CPU IIUC.

Based on what I said, I still don't believe they are needed, but please
correct me if I am wrong.

Please separate refactoring changes in general from functional changes
because it makes code review harder.

In this specific instance, I think moving the code is probably not worth
it, as there's also no point in allocating requests if we cannot
allocate buffers. In fact, since the buffers are larger, in theory their
allocation is more likely to fail, so it makes since to do it first.

Anyway, please propose such refactoring changes separately and they can
be discussed as such.

As I mentioned above, I believe compress/decompress cannot run on a CPU
before the onlining completes. Please correct me if I am wrong.

This makes sense. When you move the refactoring to create
acomp_ctx_dealloc() to a separate patch, please include this change in
it and call it out explicitly in the commit message.

I believe cpuhp_state_add_instance() calls the onlining function
synchronously on all present CPUs, so I don't think it's possible to end
up in a state where the pool is being destroyed and some CPU executed
zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() while others haven't.

That being said, this made me think of a different problem. If pool
destruction races with CPU onlining, there could be a race between
zswap_cpu_comp_prepare() allocating resources and
zswap_cpu_comp_dealloc() (or acomp_ctx_dealloc()) freeing them.

I believe we must always call cpuhp_state_remove_instance() *before*
freeing the resources to prevent this race from happening. This needs to
be documented with a comment.

Let me know if I missed something.

Yeah if we need to initialize all/most fields to 0 let's use
alloc_percpu_gfp() and pass GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO.

But start_stop_khugepaged() doesn't unconditionally start khugepaged, it takes
action based on hugepage_pmd_enabled() which only returns true if there are any
pmd sized THP enabled (currently looking at anon and file, but should also look
at shmem in future; that's a known bug that's been there forever). So I don't
think it is inconsistent with the documentation?

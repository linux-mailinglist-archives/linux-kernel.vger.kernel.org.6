When we get to guests doing FF-A, I still think the host should be
responsible for the version negotiation and guests should just be given
whatever has been negotiated. We could extend the hypervisor to marshall
between different versions, but I'd rather do that only if we actually
need it.

Right, and we currently don't support guest-ffa, so no problem :)

Can you give a specific example of why impersonating a direct call is a
problem? I agree that it sounds bad, but the hypervisor is still in the
middle and so it can check what the call is requesting.

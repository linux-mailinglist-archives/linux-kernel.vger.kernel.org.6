Yeah I think it's time to consider sunsetting Python 2.  As Ian and
James said, it was bothering some development.

Andi, do you still use it with Python 2?  Or do you know anybody who
might suffer from this change?  Is it hard to upgrade the system?

I'm inclined to pick up this change unless there's a specific reason.

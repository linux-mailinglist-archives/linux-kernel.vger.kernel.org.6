Whilst only Qualcomm can say definitively whether or not they are
affected (and what values of 'k' are required for the loop-based
workarounds), I can't help but wonder whether the current mitigation
code is structured the wrong way around in this case.

It looks to me like we don't have a way to identify a "vulnerable" CPU
for Spectre-BHB; either a CPU has some sort of mitigation or it's
unaffected. That means that there's very little incentive for vendors
to add their CPUs to one of the lists -- if they do nothing, userspace
is told that everything is golden and they don't pay the performance
hit of a workaround!

So I think we should consider turning this on its head and assume that
CPUs we don't know about are vulnerable, having a list of unaffected
cores that predate the introduction of CSV2.3 which can be queried by
is_spectre_bhb_affected(). We can do that without the assistance of the
CPU vendors.

Does that make sense, or did I miss something?

Will

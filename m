1. I don't see any tags in most of the patches so don't get the rush. This
   includes also patches for x86. Why I would care to review TPM patches
   when there is over a dozen unreviewed and untested patches before it?
2. TPM patches have been in circulation in and out of the patch set
   for some time now with little or no improvement.

Why the sudden buzz? I have not heard much about this since last early
summer.  Have to spend some time recalling what this is about anyway. I
cannot trust that my tags make any sense before more reviewed/tested-by
tags before the TPM patches.

BR, Jarkko

Then I think it's a real problem and perf should report it like we do
now.

Yep, we can do that if the kernel provides the info.  But before that
I think it's practical to skip uncore PMUs and hope other PMUs don't
have event aliases clashing with the legacy names. :)

Yep, that's also possible.  I'm ok if you want to go that direction.

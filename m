The perf tool can specify any CPU the users want, as long as the kernel
can respond properly. I'm not worried about it. The "event.cpus" is
exposed by the kernel. The main concern is also from the kernel side.
Some drivers may use it to distinguish different scopes of counters. So
they can combine various types of counters into a single PMU, which may
break some rules they don't realize. An example is the above 'group' rule.

The cpumask cannot tell such information. For example, the counters of
the uncore PMUs can be located in three different places, MSRs, the PCI
config space, and the MMIO space. But the scope of the uncore counters
is the same. So the cpumask is the same for various uncore PMUs.
To get the information, the kernel has to be updated, e.g., add a
caps/counter_type in sysfs.

Kees, sorry, I wasn't intending to be criticism of your work; I know
you've been careful.  What I was reacting was Justin's comment that
it's important to annotate every single expected overflow case.  This
sounded like the very common attitude of "type II errors must be
avoided at all costs", even in that means a huge number of "type I
errors".  And false positive errors invariably end up requiring work
on the part of over-worked maintainers.

From my perspective, it's OK if we don't find all possible security
bugs if we can keep the false negative rate down to near-zero.
Because if it's too high, I will just start ignoring all of the
"security reports", just out of self-defense.  This is now the case
with clusterfuzz reports example.  The attemp[t to shame/pressure me
with "fix this RIGHT NOW or we will make the report public in 30 days"
no longer works on me, because the vast majority of the reports
against e2fsprogs are bullshit.  And there are many syzkaller reports
which are also bullshit, and when they are reported against our data
center kernels, they get down-prioritized to P3 and ignored, because
they can't happen in real life.  But they still get reported to
upstream (me).

This is why I am worried when there are proposals to add new
sanitizers; even if they are used responsibly by you, I can easily see
them resulting in more clusterfuzz reports (for example) that I will
have to ignore as bullshit.  So please considerr this a plea to
**really** seriously reduce the false positive rate of sanitizers
whenever possible.

Cheers,

					- Ted

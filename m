Thanks for the shared links.  Based on the info, let's say we can have two
cases:

  Case 1: set different branch filters in a single perf session:

    perf record -e armv8_pmuv3_0/r03,branch_type=any_call/u \
                -e armv8_pmuv3_0/r04,branch_type=any_ret/k ...

  Case 2: set different branch filters in multiple perf sessions:

    perf record -e armv8_pmuv3_0/r03,branch_type=any_call/u ...

    perf record -e armv8_pmuv3_0/r04,branch_type=any_ret/k ...

In my previous reply, I was suggesting that we should reject the case 1.
IMO, it is not quite useful to configure different filters for events in
the same session, especially if this leads complexity in the driver due
to the hardware limitation.

For case 2, when create a new session, if the perf tool can read out the
current branch filter setting (e.g. via sysfs node) and give suggestion
what branch filter is compabile with existed sessions, seems to me, this
is a feasible solution.  My understanding this is a rare case, and a
clear guidance for users would be sufficient if this happens.  (Maybe
we can give recommendation for how to use BRBE in the perf doc).

To be clear, an important factor is the trace modes with modifier 'u'
(user) and 'k' (kernel) should be supported for different events and for
different sessions.  In a mixed cases (some events are userspace only
and some are kernel only), the BRBE driver needs to filter out branch
records for specific mode when taking a sample.

My understanding is this would be not difficult to do such kind checking
in the tool.  E.g., the perf tool can iterate every event and check the
branch filter and detect incompabile issue.

As said above, if the BRBE driver can provide a knob in sysfs to indicate
what is the current branch filter in the existed sessions, this would be
helpful for the tool to do the checking and remind users.

I haven't done any experiments for this. If you think this is the way
to move forward, I might do a prototype and get back to you to ensure we
don't run into any unexpected issues.

[...]

To make the discussion easier, I would like reply separately regarding
the branch record save and restore issue.

Thanks,
Leo

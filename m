Why?

I can understand hiding an option when it *really* depends on something
that isn't available, but the kernel not having knowledge of a specific
soc/platform isn't the same thing -- it's an entirely synthetic
dependency.

What problem is solved by not allowing the user to select this?

As above, that means that the kernel needs to have knowledge of the
specific platform, which in general we've been moving *away* form (e.g.
with DT and ACPI tables). For virtial platformas specifically that's a
massive pain because they're *so* configurable -- there's not much the
kernel can rely on being present/absent, and users will want to enable
specific features depending on what they're trying to test, at which
point they'd have to hack Kconfig files...

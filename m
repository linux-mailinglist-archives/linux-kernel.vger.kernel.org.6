Yeah, UKI addons, as well as credential files, and sysext/confext
DDIs.

The addons are the most interesting btw, because we load them into
memory as PE files, and ask the UEFI to authenticate them.

It doesn't have to be VFAT btw. It just has to be something. For
example, it might suffice to take these files, pack them up as cpio or
so and pass them along with the UEFI execution. The UEFI emulator
would then have to expose them as a file system then.

We are not talking of a bazillion of files here, it's mostly a
smallish number of sidecar files I'd expect.

Hmm, I'd really think about this with some priority. The measurement
stuff should not be an afterthought, it typically has major
implications on how you design your transitions, because measurements
of some component always need to happen *before* you pass control to
it, otherwise they are pointless.

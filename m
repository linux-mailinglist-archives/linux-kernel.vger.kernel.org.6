Which tasks did you set SCHED_BATCH here? I'm assuming the mysql
'connection' tasks on the SUT (1 task for each virtual user I guess).

I did this and see that the regression goes away. I'm using a similar
test setup (hammerdb - mysql on AWS EC2 instances).

I'm not sure yet how reliable my results are. The big unknown is the
host system when I use AWS EC2 instances for hammerdb (Load Gen) and
mysql (server). In case I gather test results over multiple days, the
host system might have changed?

I also tried the (not-mainlined) RESPECT_SLICE (NO_RUN_TO_PARITY)
features which shows similar results compared to SCHED_BATCH for those
threads.

IIRC, RESPECT_SLICE was also helping Gautham to get the performance back
for his 'sysbench + mysql' workload:

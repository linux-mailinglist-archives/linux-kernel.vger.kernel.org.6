Yes that is the intention. I should update the commit message.

I have been using this on two different test machines, as well as a
chromebook, and it appears to work on all ofthem. As well as for VMs. I
plan on adding this to my workstation and server too (they use EFI).

Agreed. Note, it should definitely state that this is not 100% reliable,
and depending on the setup it may not be reliable at all. Whatever uses it
should add something to confirm that the memory is the same.

If corner cases become an issue, this could be extended to work with them.
We could update KASLR to be aware of this allocation. The documentation
update to kernel-parameters.txt on this usage should definitely stress that
this can be unreliable, and use should be tested to see if it works. And
also stress that if it does work, it may not work all the time. The best
usage for this is for statistical debugging. For instance, in our use case,
we have 1000s of crashes that we have no idea why. If this worked only 10%
of the time, the data retrieved from 100 of those crashes would be very
valuable.

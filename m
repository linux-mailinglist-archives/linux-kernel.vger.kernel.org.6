I don't think I understand the problem. I also don't understand drivers
much -- so that might be the problem.

So the problem appears to be that the device just disappears without
warning? How can a GPU go away like that?

Since you have a notion of this device, can't you do this stubbing you
talk about? That is, if your internal device reference becomes NULL, let
the PMU methods preserve the state like no-ops.

And then when the last event goes away, tear down the whole thing.

Again, I'm not sure I'm following.

I think it's worth trying so I'll give it a go and see if it ends up
being cleaner. One of the reasons for emitting multiple packets was to
tie events and sinks together that may not have been created when the
first set of HW_IDs were output. It seems like static sink IDs could
solve this with less repetition.

We could also use the existing sink IDs that are used to select the sink
on the perf commandline: coresight_get_sink_by_id().

The issue is more about trace in a single buffer with overlapping IDs.
Whether we use a sink ID or the CPU+ID mappings, Perf still needs to
know when to change the tree. In either case we'd have to re-emit the
mappings to prompt the decoder change.

So yes with either solution there would be multiple decode trees, it's
just knowing which fragments to send to which tree that's the issue.

This is already indicated with the PERF_AUX_FLAG_CORESIGHT_FORMAT_RAW
flag on the AUX record. But I suppose we could add sink ID 0x0 as well
for consistency with the new HW_ID packets. For backwards compatibility
it probably makes sense to continue using the AUX flag in Perf, but I'll
see how it looks with the sink ID implementation.

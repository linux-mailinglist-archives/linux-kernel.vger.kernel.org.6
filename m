I agree with Samuel's analysis that "interrupt-parent" is not always
relevant to unsuspecting devices, given that it is often inherited
from a bus-wide or system-wide parent node. Collectively, "interrupts"
(which implicitly uses "interrupt-parent"), "interrupt-extended" and
"interrupt-map" should provide enough information to ensure correct
dependency tracking.

This is a notable departure from "msi-parent", which itself doesn't
require any extra specifier, and cannot be ignored here (I note the
absence of "msi-map" tracking though).

I'm afraid other architectures are not any better. RISC-V only has the
dubious advantage of coming up with backward designs, which doesn't
help.

This needs testing, but looks sane from my PoV (though it is early and
I need single coffee)... FWIW:

Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.

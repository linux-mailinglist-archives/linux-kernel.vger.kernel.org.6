I got some hardware with the DSU PMU so I'm going to have a go at trying 
to send some fixes for this. My initial idea was to try incorporate the 
"not terminate on opening" change as discussed in the link directly 
above. And then do the revert of the "revert of prefer sysfs/json".

FWIW I don't think Juno currently is broken if the kernel supports 
extended type ID? I could have missed some output in this thread but it 
seems like it's mostly related to Apple M hardware. I'm also a bit 
confused why the "supports extended type" check fails there, but maybe 
the v6.9 commit 25412c036 from Mark is missing?

I sent a small fix the other day to make perf stat default arguments 
work on Juno, and didn't notice anything out of the ordinary: 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-perf-users/dac6ad1d-5aca-48b4-9dcb-ff7e54ca43f6@linaro.org/T/#t
I agree that change is quite narrow but it does incrementally improve 
things for the time being. It's possible that it would become redundant 
if I can just include Ian's change to use strings for Perf stat.

Of course I only think I have a handle on the issue right now, seems 
like it has a lot of moving parts and something else always comes up. If 
I hit a wall at some point I will come back here.

Thanks
James

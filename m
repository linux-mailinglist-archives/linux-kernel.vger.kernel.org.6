I see this patch as a whac-a-mole approach.  But it should be applied as
a stopgap, because my patches are still not ready to be merged.

My patch is more generic, but *only* solves the rstat lock contention
part of the issue.  The remaining issue is that rstat is flushed too
often, which I address in my other patch[2] "cgroup/rstat: introduce
ratelimited rstat flushing".  In [2], I explicitly excluded memcg as
Shakeel's patch demonstrates memcg already have a ratelimit API specific
to memcg.

https://lore.kernel.org/all/171328990014.3930751.10674097155895405137.stgit@firesoul/

I suspect the next whac-a-mole will be the rstat flush for the slab code
that kswapd also activates via shrink_slab, that via
shrinker->count_objects() invoke count_shadow_nodes().

Oh sorry, yes that is an LLVM bug link. I mixed something up. I could have sworn 
there was a GCC bug, but I only found 
<https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=57359> which has been fixed.
There was some problem with strong updates, i.e. the standard permits writes 
through a `float*` pointer to memory that aliases an `int*`. The C aliasing 
model only says it is UB to read data at the wrong type, but does not talk about 
writes changing the type of memory.
Martin, maybe you remember better than me what that issue was / whether it is 
still a problem?

Hm, now I am wondering how clang is compliant here. To my knowledge, padding is 
effectively reset to poison or undef on a copy (due to SROA), and clang marks 
most integer types as "noundef", thus making it UB to ever have undef/poison in 
such a value.

Kind regards,
Ralf

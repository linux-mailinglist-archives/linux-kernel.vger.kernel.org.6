sched: Document wait_var_event() family of functions and wake_up_var()

wake_up_var(), wait_var_event() and related interfaces are not
documented but have important ordering requirements.  This patch adds
documentation and makes these requirements explicit.

The return values for those wait_var_event_* functions which return a
value are documented.  Note that these are, perhaps surprisingly,
sometimes different from comparable wait_on_bit() functions.

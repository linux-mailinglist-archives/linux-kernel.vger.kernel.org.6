Well, not exactly "expecting", but unfamiliar.  I've mostly been living
in in arch/arm{,64}/ where it's common to have lines a little shorter.

I guess my issue is that the "Massage commit message" seems to document
a criticism that the author was careless, didn't follow a rule, or that
the commit message was defective in some way, with the author having no
right of reply (at least, not recorded in the git history).

I may just be being too touchy.

Anyway, thanks for picking up the patch -- I'm not trying to make extra
work for anyone.

Cheers

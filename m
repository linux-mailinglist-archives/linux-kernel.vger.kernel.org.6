I wonder if there wouldn't be other kernel information about things that
may have affected the time it took for the task to be off-cpu, maybe
system load average, C/P states, but then it would be overengineering, I
think, just thought about what else we could add that could help
understanding the off-cpu time that could be obtained from the vantage
point of BPF attached to sched-out and sched-in, things we could collect
at sched-out in addition to the timestamp and ditto at sched-in, but I'm
no scheduler expert, so take this just as some brainstorming. Maybe we
could have some sort of sample_type specific to this off-cpu event that
would allow us to ask for extra info in an extensible way. We can start
with just PERF_OFFCPU_SAMPLE_TIMESTAMP...

Yes, we should not reinvent the wheel for all things that can be asked
from the kernel perf subsystem, only using the raw-data payload on the
bpf-output event for things we can't get from the perf subsystem, and
that is the timestamp for a previous event stored in a BPF map, looking
if the delta to the current time (on a sched-in event) is over the
threshold and then recording this time on this specific "made-up on the
fly using BPF" event that appears on the ring buffer just like any other
"native" events such as tracepoints, hardware events, cache events, etc.

Doesn't this exactly kind of Just Work though? "This binary can
do/tolerate sealing". I would blindly guess that we don't have very
opinionated shared libraries that do this kind of shenanigans
unilaterally, so that's probably not something we really need to worry
about (though I admittedly need to read through the glibc patchset,
and nail down what they're thinking about doing with linking
mseal-ready and mseal-non-ready ELF execs/shared objects together).
The problem with something like prctl is that we either indirectly
provide some kind of limited form of munseal, or we require some sort
of handover (like personality(2) + execve(2)), which both sound like a
huge PITA and still don't solve any of our backwards compat issues...
all binaries would need to be patched with this
prctl/personality()/whatever call, and old ones wouldn't work.

The semantics behind GNU_PROPERTY_MEMORY_SEAL are unclear to me (maybe
the toolchain folks could shed some light?), but it sounds like it'd
fit perfectly.
I suspect we probably want to parse this on the kernel's side anyway
(to seal the main program/interp's segments)[1], then extending them
to the kernel system mappings should be somewhat trivial...
I don't think we'll ever get a program that can't cope with sealing
the system mappings but can cope with sealing itself (and if we do, we
just won't seal the entire thing and that's _okay_).

Deploying mseal-ready programs could then be done in a phased way by
distros. e.g chromeOS and android could simply enable the
corresponding linker option in LDFLAGS and let it rip. Other more
mainstream distros could obviously take a little longer or test/deploy
this on all programs not named gVisor and/or after CRIU is okay with
all of this. We then might not need a user-configurable CONFIG_ (only
an arch HAS_SYSTEM_MAPPINGS_MSEAL or whatever), nor a sysctl, and
everyone is happy.

I glanced through libc-alpha again and it seems like the glibc folks
also seem to have reached the same idea, but I'd love to hear from
Adhemerval.

Am I missing anything?


[1] we should probably nail this responsibility handover down before
glibc msealing (or bionic) makes it to a release. It'd probably be a
little nicer if we could mseal these segments from the kernel instead
of forcing the libc to take care of this, now that we have this
property.

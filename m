Yeah, no. container_of() is absolutely trivial and very readable.
container_of_const() a lot less so.

(one static_assert() removed)

#define container_of(ptr, type, member) ({                              \
        void *__mptr = (void *)(ptr);                                   \
        ((type *)(__mptr - offsetof(type, member))); })

Which is very clear indeed in what it does. Compare with:

#define struct_size(p, member, count)                                   \
        __builtin_choose_expr(__is_constexpr(count),                    \
                sizeof(*(p)) + flex_array_size(p, member, count),       \
                size_add(sizeof(*(p)), flex_array_size(p, member, count)))

And I still have no idea :-(

I'm sure you know what it does. Thing is, I don't care because I can
trivially write it myself and not have to care and I'll have forgotten
all about it the moment I sent this email.

It just doesn't make sense to wrap something as utterly trivial as:

	size = sizeof(*p) + num*sizeof(p->foo);

We're going to have to agree to disagree on this.

Note how I naturally get the order wrong?

[[ There is the whole FMA angle to this, that is, fundamentally this is a
multiply-accumulate, but the problem there is the same that I noted,
there is no fixed order, a+b*c and a*b+c are both very common
definitions -- although I lean towards the latter being the correct one,
given the order in the naming. I suppose this is a long winded way of
saying that:

#define struct_size(p, member, num) \
	mult_add_no_overflow(num, sizeof(p->member), sizeof(*p))

would be *FAR* more readable. And then I still think struct_size() is
less readable than its expansion. ]]

Some day I'll have to look at this FORTIFY_SOURCE and see what it
actually does I suppose :/

I coulnd't quickly find a single instance in the code I care about. So
nothing is sailing afaict.

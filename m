My concern is that we may end needing QAPI for querying stuff
that will be used on such script.

On a more concrete example, let's suppose we want to produce a
HEST record for a CXL source, using the layout given by a QEMU

There is a complex set of CXL devices there. Doing error injection
will need to know exactly how such devices were created and the
memory got allocated, as, when testing an userspace application
running at the guest OS (like rasdaemon), we need an address that
makes sense, otherwise the memory poison of rasdaemon won't be
disabling the right address set.

So, while a HEST QAPI raw interface will have a very trivial API,
and the ghes code being also simpler, we'll need a QAPI interface
good enough to describe all CXL specific details for the error
injection script to produce a proper HEST record, if this ends
being mapped using such QAPI.

My end goal is to be able to use QEMU to validate and identify 
regressions at the Linux Kernel RAS subsystem and at the userspace 
daemon responsible to receive, log and take actions based on the 
error information (on other words, rasdaemon). Not only for
ARM, but also for x86 (and maybe in the future for other archs,
depending on how they end implementing RAS features).

At the end of the day, I'd like to have a github action running QEMU
to check  rasdaemon proposed patches against a docker container with
the latest version of Linux and QEMU.

Yes, the end goal is to inject GHESv2 errors using a generic
event device, e. g.:

For CPU error injection, certainly the amount of code for the error
injection won't change much. The code will be split into QEMU C code 
and Python's code (inside a qemu-einj.py script). As raw data won't
be validated, some code may actually be removed.

On the other hand, some new query QAPI interfaces will be needed,
specially when handling memory-related HEST data, as the memory 
layout with enough details for the script to properly produce errors
will be needed.

So, we're talking on adding a couple of additional QAPIs. The
advantage is that such QAPIs will be independent of the ghes
driver, but some may be arch-specific, like the ones reporting fields
like ARM mpidr, midr, power_state, for instance. On an initial
implementation, we can live without those, but for the ARM processor
error injection.

I'll try to craft a proposal with a very minimal QAPI for GHESv2
injection, implementing it for ARM processor (and maybe for some other
type, to check if the interface will fit). Let's see how it goes.

Makes sense to me.

Well, if we go to a generic GHESv2 QAPI interface, the arm/virt.c
will have everything in place to generate GHESv2. It could be used
to simulate a x86 processor event, as the changes will happen at
the script side. We'll still need to add the needed bits at x86
virt code, though, if we want the error injection to be tested
against a guest doing x86 emulation.

Not sure. I guess it will depend if we'll be using a simple raw data
buffer for CPER record(s) or if we'll break it per CPER type.

The GHES interface for generic CPER records would be simpler, but it
may require some QEMU query QAPIs for the script to be able to get
what it is needed..

Let me try to code it and see how it goes.

Agreed: placing it together with QEMU is indeed the best location.

Yes, I understand the difference. My question is why should upstream 
support that? Normally, I wouldn't notice or care, but the churn of 
renaming everything makes me notice. Why do the maintainers need to 
review all these extra changes because QCom couldn't figure out their 
plans?

So after you duplicate all the compatible strings, what's next? Changing 
all the SA8775p bindings which is an ABI break? Presumably, some 
bindings may not change at all? In that case, you don't need any rename.
I have no visibility into what's coming next, so please educate me.

The minimal amount of changes here is you are stuck with the existing 
identifiers for the non-SCMI SKU. Then you can add a "new SoC" for the 
SCMI SKU. You might not like the names now, but you picked them and are 
kind of stuck with them.

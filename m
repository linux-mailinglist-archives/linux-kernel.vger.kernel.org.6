Yeah, it's messy.  The "nicest" thing I could think of was doing a GCS
store of the value we just read to validate the GCS permission but that
has very obvious ick and is in it's own way incorrect.  Since the GCS
permission is always read/write I'm not sure what would notice without
an incredibly dodgy race but it's wrong.

Yeah, that doesn't feel like the solution.

I'm not completely opposed to just not doing the validation given the
pain with implementing it, it's hard to be enthusiastic about any of the
options really.  If we are going to do something other than fully
and accurately emulate then we should acknowledge what's missing and
why, at least in the changelog and probably also in the code.

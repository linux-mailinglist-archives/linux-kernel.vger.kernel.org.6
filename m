DT describes the Hardware, I don't see how the new bindings describes better
the current hardware... tying the new bindings to a new driver is actually
against the DT rules, the bindings thing is actually to avoid that.
For PWM, bindings architecture was clearly wrong, but here, not really.

I still don't see the problem of migrating current users to the new driver
using the current compatible, really, please explain what would be the problem ?

In any case you'll only need to add the #io-channel-cells to boards that would
require frequency monitoring for eARC, for all the other boards you'll won't need it.
So this property can safely be added as optional to the current bindings.

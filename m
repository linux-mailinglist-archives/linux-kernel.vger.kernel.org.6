Sure thing; just note that there's no guarantee that this is only
"occasionally" garbage -- this could be wrong 1% of the time or 99% of
the time depending on the specific scenario, HW it's running on, etc. As
long as you're happy to hold the pieces when that happens, that's fine.

I've pushed out fixes to the arm64/stacktrace/fixes branch on my
kernel.org git repo:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mark/linux.git/log/?h=arm64/stacktrace/fixes
  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mark/linux.git arm64/stacktrace/fixes

... and I'll get that out as a series on the list tomorrow.

Mark.

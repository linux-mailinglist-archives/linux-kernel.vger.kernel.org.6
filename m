Yes I understand, I'll re-test it on a Juno with a newer kernel.

The columns are:
- the _base configuration disables EAS/feec() when in the overutilized state,
   i.e. patches 1-3 are applied.
- the _ou configuration keeps running EAS/feec() when in the overutilized state
   i.e. patches 1-4 are applied
- the _ol configuration should be ignored as previously established

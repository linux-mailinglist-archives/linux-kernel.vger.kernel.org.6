Hi Andrew,

Thanks for pointing this out. I forgot about the interrupt shadow on SYSCALL
and possibly some breakpoints possibilities in the kernel.

I don't see it, because if attacker starts at syscall entry and interrupts are 
enabled and the interrupt happens right there the handler will just see proper 
IRET frame with %cs of kernel and will not perform swapgs. I will try to think 
about it again tomorrow I likely missed something.

Thank you for your detailed explanation.

Maybe more elegant and cheap check on IDT entry "authenticity" would be to check 
for current %ss which needs to be NULL and possibly check the %CS on stack frame
by checking kernel %cs and not just two CPL bits and/or perform more checks.

Another ideas if you think it is still worth to discuss this topic:

What about to use completely different %CS selector for all entry code? The 
early entry code would check the %cs selector and panic if it is wrong one.

After swapgs dance, we need to perform far jump to normal kernel %CS, which 
might cost something.

To fix the interrupt on fake entry problem, we could check in relevant IDT 
handlers that we never come from "completely different" %CS used above for the 
early entry code.

And very last idea would be to somehow persuade the Last Branch Recording to 
record exception entries only and just check it from MSR. But maybe it is too 
costly and/or not possible.

Thanks,
Rudolf

Well, sorry, you did do that, by patching the compiler in a way which 
makes it no longer happen as before. If LLVM is otherwise able to make 
this optimisation as expected then to me that sounds like your patch 
effectively causes a codegen regression in LLVM, thus it should hardly 
be the concern of Linux, nor every other project which may get worse 
codegen because of it, to work around it.

Regardless of whether people think it's reasonable to *depend* on 
compiler optimisation or not, emitting dead code which was not 
previously emitted at the same optimisation level seems like a clear 
step backwards.

I'm not a compiler guy, but is it really that complex when the variable 
is only ever written with the same compile-time-constant value that it's 
already initialised with? If the optimisation pass is so focused on 
being able to use a conditional store instruction that it would rather 
emit one which has no effect either way than elide it entirely, that 
doesn't strike me as a particularly good optimisation :/

Thanks,
Robin.

I don't understand what you mean by that. The point here is that these
are simple devices with a single memory resource (just like CMN-700),
where in each case, a driver using devm_{platform_}ioremap_resource()
(just like arm-cmn) has happily claimed (2nd line) the same resource
already defined by the ACPI layer (1st line). Admittedly it's a little
unclear since they both use the same name, but still.

Sigh... No, this is unique to CMN-600, because only the CMN-600 ACPI
binding depends on nested resources, such that the resource tree
starts off looking like this:

50000000-5fffffff : ARMHC600:00
   50d00000-50d03fff : ARMHC600:00

If we wanted to, we can still quite happily claim the root node
resource:

--- a/drivers/perf/arm-cmn.c
+++ b/drivers/perf/arm-cmn.c
@@ -2410,6 +2410,8 @@ static int arm_cmn600_acpi_probe(struct platform_device *pdev, struct arm_cmn *c

         if (!resource_contains(cfg, root))
                 swap(cfg, root);
+
+       devm_request_mem_region(cmn->dev, root->start, resource_size(root), "arm-cmn!");
         /*
          * Note that devm_ioremap_resource() is dumb and won't let the platform
          * device claim cfg when the ACPI companion device has already claimed


...which then nests like so:

50000000-5fffffff : ARMHC600:00
   50d00000-50d03fff : ARMHC600:00
     50d00000-50d03fff : arm-cmn!

but what we cannot do is claim the whole 50000000-5fffffff region again
because that cannot nest within the existing 50d00000-50d03fff region.

As I said, the driver already supports the CMN-700 APCI binding
perfectly well. If your CMN is described correctly then you need to
answer my question of what *other* driver is claiming conflicting
resources and why (and if so, also why that should be specific to ACPI).

Thanks,
Robin.

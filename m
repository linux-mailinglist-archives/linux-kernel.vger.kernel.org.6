The RCU interfaces do force a lot of function calls for things that
should be inlined though, and the gratuitious interface fragmentation
between RCU and SRCU is... annoying.

Cache locality where?

On the enqueue side, which is the fastpath, this uses a cursor - we're
not walking the radix tree every time.

On the processing side, where we're kfree_bulk()ing entire radix tree
nodes, the radix tree is going to have better cache locality than a list
of pages.

That's reasonable - as long as we're trying the 16 byte allocation
before doing a synchronize_rcu().

Glad to here, that was first on my list when adding a shrinker to this
code.

As mentioned, there's a cursor so we're not adding radix-tree overhead
to the fast path, and there's no need to merge lists for expired objects
- that's all handled fine.

But yes, using it for call_rcu() would need more performance
justification. I haven't seen workloads where call_rcu() performance
particularly matters, so it's not something I'm pushing for - I included
that because it's minimal code and other people might know of workloads
where we do want it.

No, because that's unpredictable, and we don't process pending items in
enqueue() unless we know we can sleep (i.e., we don't do it if the
caller is latency sensitive).

As a group, we can state quite affirmatively to the fact that we have
experience and understanding in use of memory allocation instruction
flags.  Our use of namespace specific event processing structure
caches is not driven by unfamiliarity with the use and implications of
GFP_ATOMIC.

The use of independent structure magazines, for security events
running in atomic context in a security modeling namespace, is driven
by the need to prevent security adversaries from placing pressure on
the global kernel atomic page reserves.

These namespace specific event magazines prevent an adversary from
waging a memory denial of service attack against the kernel at large.
Adversaries can only impair their own functionality in a security
modeling namespace through the use of a synthetic attack workload that
stresses the availability of atomic context memory.

Further, TSEM is formulated on the premise that software teams,
as a by product of CI/CD automation and testing, can develop precise
descriptions of the security behavior of their workloads.  One
component of that description is the cache depth needed to support
security event handlers running in atomic context.

Exceeding that cache depth would be a sentinel forensic event for a
workload.  For anyone unfamiliar with modern IT security
architectures, a very specific alert on your security dashboard that
one of the tens of thousands of workloads that are running is doing
something it shouldn't.

Adversaries really hate to be noticed.

It was our understanding that the administrative guides to a security
architecture are intended to provide comprehensive information on the
use and management of the implementation.

We were attempting to be thorough in the description and rationale for
all the technical aspects of TSEM.  The discourse in
Documentation/memory-barriers.txt would seem to provide justification
for intimate detail on important operational issues in the kernel.

The atomic structure magazine sizes (cache depth) can be set on a per
namespace basis, including the root modeling namespace.

Our current development tree, on our GitHub site if anyone is
interested, has simplified the cache sizing by using a single default
value that is of sufficient size to boot a standard Linux (Debian)
implementation.

For subordinate modeling namespaces, experience has shown that to be
more than what is needed, but it greatly simplifies the ability to use
TSEM 'out of the box'.

We still need to update the documentation to call out this fact and
note that development teams can adjust this value downward for
subordinate workloads that require lower levels of atomic event
reserves, if there is a desire to save memory.  Or upward if a
workload generates a pathologically large corpus of security events
that run in atomic context.

One could arguably make this self-tuning by setting a low water mark
that would trigger the expansion of the depth of the event structure
caches.  Which would invariably lead to a request to have a tunable to
set that low water mark....

Not to mention an argument about the performance impacts of locking
the namespace context to prevent atomic context events from running
while the event magazines are expanded.

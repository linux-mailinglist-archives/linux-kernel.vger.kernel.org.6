The only thing I can imagine is that it may be used to disclose the
event constraint information, Or even more to update/override the event
constraint information (which requires kernel update.). But what I'm
worried about is that it may be abused. It's very easy to confuse an
event and a counter in a PMU.

For core PMU, the parallel may not work, because the core PMU is usually
MSR based. Perf has to access the MSRs on the specific CPU. IPIs may be
triggered if the users try to operate them from the other CPUs.

But the parallel is good for the counters in the MMIO space. The
counters can be accessed from any CPU. There are more and more counters
which are moved to the MMIO space, e.g., new uncore PMUs, IOMMU PMU,
TMPI (for power), etc.
